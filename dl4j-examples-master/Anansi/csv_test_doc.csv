Pedro;If my chef sees me trying to separate the yolks from the whites like this guy he'll probably shit his pants. These ain't hacks what this guy is doing is making it more harder as it is.?
Farinha;At the other end of the spectrum, weaker magnetic fields should in theory be overcome by gravity, initiating star formation.Understanding patterns in the magnetic fields of star-forming regions might help us predict how they will evolve in future. The strength of the magnetic fields in space could also influence how massive stars grow to be, and, potentially, whether planetary systems can form around them, Dr Santos added. he US-German Sofia (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) observatory is based around a modified Boeing 747SP aircraft. While flying at altitudes of about 12km (41,000ft), a large door in the aft fuselage is opened, allowing a 2.5m diameter telescope to observe the sky. The aircraft can rise above most of the water vapour in the Earth's atmosphere - which can block some infrared wavelengths from reaching the ground. The project is managed for Nasa by the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), while the German parts of the venture are managed by a special organization - the DSI (Deutsches SOFIA Institut).
Pedro Cunha;I bounced on my boys soda can to this. Be sure to bounce on it before you slice it up. Aluminum is sharp and your cornhole is sensitive. That's what my dad always said to me when he would leave to go steal peoples lawn furniture and sell it on eBay to buy me CDs and gummy bears. 
David;The British relationship with food has undergone a fundamental change over the past 50 years, and in quite a contradictory fashion. Meals were once made up of simple, local ingredients using recipes that had been followed by previous generations. Now food has become a sensory and cultural phenomenon. Food production and catering is a multi-million pound industry. Top chefs show us how to cook the most delicious 3-course meals and supermarkets provide all the ingredients we need. Yet at the same time, we are less willing to spend time cooking than was once the case and instead spend huge amounts on take-aways and ready-meals.
Bruno;Policy-makers employ a wide range of measures to tackle the problem of traffic congestion. Enforcement schemes such as setting strict speed limits on major roads and the use of congestion charges in city centres are two such examples as are vehicle exclusion zones or parking restrictions in busy pedestrian areas. However, it also makes sense to encourage motorists to become less reliant on their car. This can be achieved by making public transport more efficient and promoting the benefits of car-sharing with work colleagues, thus reducing weekly fuel bills. And the increasing number of cycle lanes on many roads is further evidence of how to win the hearts and minds of motorists in the fight against congestion.
Dalot;Mobile phones have transformed the lives of nearly everyone on the planet in the last few years . They have made communication easy and cheap between friends , family and businesses . The phones are not only used for speech and text messages but increasingly to browse the internet , to read email , to play games or to pay for products . In many countries , particularly those with slow network connections , the internet is something that happens on a mobile phone rather than on a computer . There are also disadvantages to using mobile phones . One is the potential health risk . While the information is not conclusive some people living near to mobile phone transmitters report higher rates of cancer then elsewhere . Keeping a powerful device transmitting waves and heat next to your ear for long periods of time may be harmful to heavy users of mobile phones . There are also social problems related to mobile phone use . Walking around with a phone glued to your ear may prevent you from interacting with other people while anti-social use on public transport or in the cinema has led to many public environments , such as theatres and cinemas , requesting users to switch their phones off or to silent . There are also technical issues with mobile phone use . Many areas do not have network connectivity and the reliability or audio quality of the mobile service in other areas may fall well short of that provided by a landline . Significant those these drawbacks may be , the huge convenience of the mobile phone will ensure that its use continues to change our lives.
Leonel;The tourism industry is in a state of flux  . Countries are competing for tourists by investing in their holiday destinations and thus making them more attractive and diverse. However, tourism needs to be carefully managed to prevent harm to the environment and disruption to local communities and its economy. The possible disadvantages of tourism on the one hand and new types of sustainable tourism on the other are discussed and contextualised in the two extracts. The issues touched upon in the first text are threefold: important projects for local communities might be sidelined as the focus is on infrastructure developments for tourists, the situation in environmental problem zones may be exacerbated by, for example, water cycle damage and on top of that, the profits of tourism often are not for the benefit of the local population. Instead global players such as hotels or airlines walk off with their pockets full. The flaws of tourism are contrasted by trends such as eco-tourism  which aims at reducing the impact that tourism has on naturally beautiful environments. Eco-tourism is based upon the idea that the natural environment and local communities are not exploited by tourism. All tourism projects are designed in cooperation with local communities. Infrastructure improvements have to benefit local inhabitants and not just tourists. Tourism nowadays has to be seen in the context of climate change and declining natural resources. Some remote islands or regions located on the shore may disappear in the forseeable future  due to rising sea levels. We should do our utmost to put off such a bleak scenario by travelling responsibly, avoiding long-distance flights as much as we can, protecting resources by not taking too many showers, eating local food and drink and not using air-conditioning into the bargain. It is about time we heed these guidelines. Otherwise we will be the ones experiencing the devastating consequences first hand.
Filipe;Threatening legal action was a bit ridiculous but the reviewer did fail to do their research which is part of their job and calling the developer lazy is reminiscent of the pot and kettle.﻿
Stephane;The film centers on Thor, reeling after an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Hela, who lands on a distant planet and is immediately kidnapped and forced into gladiatorial combat. His opponent: The Incredible Hulk, last seen leaving Earth at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Daniel;I'm an English teacher and I have a big family, so I have a very busy daily routine! First, I get up every day at six o’clock, get washed and dressed, and leave for work by seven-thirty. I get to school at eight o’clock. I prepare my lessons and then teach until noon. The other teachers and I always eat lunch and talk together in the teachers’ room. I teach again in the afternoon and then I correct my students’ homework and tests. After I get back home, I help my kids with their homework. I have three kids in elementary school. Their names are Mathew, Jon and Suzie. Then, I do some exercise, eat dinner with my family and watch TV before I go to bed at about ten o’clock. We love to watch travel shows. Finally, I read in bed for a few minutes before I fall asleep.
Miguel;The chart shows CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre for various methods of transport in the European Union while the pie chart shows European Union spending on transport . Flying by air produces by far the greatest CO2 emissions , approximately three times as much as passenger cars which are the next largest producers! Very little is spent by the EU on air travel while roads make up more than half of the EU transport budget. Trains produce about three times less CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre than passenger cars and eight times less than air travel . Nearly a third of EU transport funds are spent on railways . Ships are a clean form of transport and produce about the same amount of CO2 per passenger kilometre as trains do . However , only 2 percent of EU funds are spent on ports . A further one percent is spent on inland waterways . Coaches are the cleanest form of transport . Emissions of CO2 per passenger kilometre from coaches are half those of buses . Buses emit less than half as much CO2 per passenger kilometre as cars . The European union spends 10 percent of its transport budget on public transport , such as buses and coaches.
Adriano;The idea that both parents should contribute actively to bringing up their offspring would seem hard to dispute . This does not mean however that all tasks in the child rearing process should be shared equally . The idea of tasks being shared equally between parents contains several assumptions . One assumption is that both parents have equal amounts of available time and are both available to do what is required at the time it is required . Clearly this is often not the case . If , for example , a child needs help with some homework one evening and one parent is required to work late , the task falls to the other parent . Therefore , despite genuine attempts to share duties equally , it will not always be practically possible to do so . The second assumption which is implied by the idea of sharing tasks equally is that both parents are equally well prepared or skilled to do all tasks . Again this is clearly not the case most of the time . For instance , it may be that the mother is a teacher and able to provide the kind of support the child needs with their homework more effectively than the father . In theory , perhaps the best approach would be to first decide what the child needs at any given time , and secondly to assess which parent is in the best position to provide this need . This approach is aimed at using the parental resources most effectively , rather than 'equally' . In conclusion , it would seem that the 'equality' point of view may not always be in the child's best interest . A more effective approach might be for couples to agree on how they can best use their resources . Even if this is accomplished however it is unlikely to be achievable constantly due to practical restraints .
Bonjardim;Our society is going through a global tendency which encourages people to cook less and buy more of these  ready-made meals. The considerable growth in the consumption of convenience food has taken place not only in  UK but in many other countries, such us in Brazil. The reasons are all quite similar across these places. People lack time to cook their own meals, yet they are interested in trying other kinds of food and the prices are generally reasonable. However, should we stop cooking altogether? The majority of people consider their lives to be too busy and cooking would not be a priority. These days most people work full-time and have many other responsibilities. Many people also have a misconception about the amount of time that is required in order to cook a simple and nutritious meal. There are a lot  dishes that can be done  with little time and with few ingredients. Another benefit of cooking from scratch is that we are fully aware of what is in our food. Despite the delicious taste of these take-away meals, we hardly ever know how it is  cooked and the quality of ingredients. In order for the industry to make a profit, they will often choose the cheapest ingredients. As a result, these types of meals are often not very nutritious. Lastly, we can save money by cooking our own meals. Even though the cost of ready-made meals are normally quite reasonable, still we will  always find ourselves saving money when we buy ingredients and cook at home. In conclusion, it was acknowledged this  current tendency to buy convenience food which helps us through our busy daily lives. However, it was also noted that we can largely benefit from cooking from scratch.
