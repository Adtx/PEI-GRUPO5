Pedro;If my chef sees me trying to separate the yolks from the whites like this guy he'll probably shit his pants. These ain't hacks what this guy is doing is making it more harder as it is.?
João;At the other end of the spectrum, weaker magnetic fields should in theory be overcome by gravity, initiating star formation.Understanding patterns in the magnetic fields of star-forming regions might help us predict how they will evolve in future. The strength of the magnetic fields in space could also influence how massive stars grow to be, and, potentially, whether planetary systems can form around them, Dr Santos added. he US-German Sofia (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) observatory is based around a modified Boeing 747SP aircraft. While flying at altitudes of about 12km (41,000ft), a large door in the aft fuselage is opened, allowing a 2.5m diameter telescope to observe the sky. The aircraft can rise above most of the water vapour in the Earth's atmosphere - which can block some infrared wavelengths from reaching the ground. The project is managed for Nasa by the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), while the German parts of the venture are managed by a special organization - the DSI (Deutsches SOFIA Institut).
