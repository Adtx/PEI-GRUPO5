    private List<String> texts= Arrays.asList("My older brother is deaf and I remember my parents talking about how the greatest difficulty wasn't in THEM coming to understand him, but getting anyone else to. Their only options for a deaf child in the late 70s early 80s was an underfunded, unpleasant and depressing state school that, in reality, functioned more like a state orphanage or choosing the aural lifestyle for him and, in a sense, trying to force to him to be hearing.\n" +
            "Fortunately, right about the time when this dilemma was facing them, the law was passed down that local school systems would HAVE to cooperate with children that had special needs for the their education. Knowing my brother, knowing the struggles my family went through and how it affected us, really drove this movie home for me. I can say without any trepidations that I absolutely loved this show so much. Not only did it NOT portray a deaf person as being \"Special,\" it also made the point of showing that the real problems for a deaf person in their life doesn't come from their own deafness but how much of society itself simply doesn't know how to react to them. My brother is smart, he's creative and a little nuts. Ok, I take that back, he's REALLY nuts and has made some dumb decisions I don't agree with. But that's the point. My brother's deafness is not his defining trait. It's simply one facet of his personality.\n" +
            "Nishimaya demonstrates that simple but often missed part of being deaf. Being deaf doesn't define her. " +
            "She is intelligent, competent and has a clear personality. This is not \"Despite\" OR \"Because\" of being deaf. It is simply one part of her character. The challenge of interacting with the Hearing is a central part of this story and really drives home the point that the people around her chose to define her BY her deafness. Lacking a proper interpreter (I never saw one) made that a serious issue. Even the people who weren't \"looking down on her\" in the aggressive sense were instead doing it from a condescending PoV. The characters who averted this tendency were the ones who realized the real challenge in her life was the bullying itself that resulted. Her family's strain, Shoya's redemption and the ultimate tragedies in the overall story are practically-speaking, derived from the bullying she experienced. In the end, it was OVERCOMING that hangup of viewing her through the lens of being \"Special\" that allows Shoya to make himself a better person and strive to improve the lives of the people around him, including her. Nishimaya isn't a DEAF person. She is a deaf PERSON and I think this movie managed to display that properly.","One thing to understand about the US is that it is actually a federation of states. Much of the day-to-day work happens at the state or local level, not at the federal level. Police, fire departments, emergency first responders mostly employed at that level, and when the federal government is involved, a lot of it is in doing some coordination between states, setting standards, funding for various programs, and so on. Even things like building interstate highways, which are funded by the federal government, are generally done by allocation to the state governments to actually construct them.\n" +
            "However, the military is entirely part of the federal government, as are many other organizations. In the case of not having a budget, the government is required to shut down all functions that are not essential for safety and security. So things like the military, the TSA, and so on can continue to function, but office workers doing jobs like allocating the funding for highway construction are furloughed, put on temporary unpaid leave from their jobs.\n" +
            "This is, of course, terrible for the efficient functioning of government; when the impasse is over, they will have to come back to their jobs and try to catch up. Oh, and in the time leading up to the shutdown, many of them would have been busy preparing for the shutdown, documenting which functions would be considered essential and thus able to continue during the shutdown; because the deadline was no surprise, and there had been many temporary funding bills leading up to this point, there was always a pretty high chance that this shutdown would happen.\n" +
            "Of course, this inefficiency plays well into the politics of one of the parties, who hold a religious " +
            "belief that private enterprise is always more efficient than government, and so playing games like this that increase its inefficiency help to sell their case and get government functions sold off to private enterprise, who just so happen, in so many cases, to be some of the largest donors to campaigns of this particular party.","I went through university not knowing how to study, and as a result, I now have a \"worthless\" degree. One thing is, that the university and the degrees I took was a joke. 3-6 hours of \"class\" (100+ people crammed into an auditorium), no graded homework or feedback during semesters, and examns was just handing in 12-15 pages of analysis, and then getting a grade on my report sheet. No contact with educators, no counselling, guidance or otherwise interaction with lecturers, educators or other staff at the university. I could sit a home 30 hours a week and still get my \"degree\". Basically no feedback from the university on how I did, where I was heading etc.\n" +
            "For me, this means I made a lot of stupid choices. For one, I never understood the degree I took, but relentlessly kept on \"fighting\", as I thought that it _had_ to make sense to me someday. It never did. Swapped studies during my masters, but got into a \"soft\" IT-programme that didn't resonate with me either. As a result, I never learned to study, because I would get stressed out that the material never really made sense to me. I couldn't connect it to anything in the real world (and perhaps more important to me - no job postings ever seemed to ask for the skills I was acquiring).\n" +
            "Today, two years after i finished with an A+ (I wonder how...), and average grades in general, I have a galloping depression, and just wish that I could do it all over. No doubt I was perhaps immature or used to be a \"natural talent\" through high school, and therefore thought University was just passing examns. That hurts me a lot, and I have a hard time letting that thought go. I don't think anyone will ever be able to convince me, that the university or classes I went to was working as intended however. In my mind, education cannot solely be based on people reading and writing for themselves.\n" +
            "I wish someone would have shown me a guide like that when I started, and helped me manage my ambitions " +
            "and performance a bit more throughout university. I'm now a worthless member of society, even though I have a degree. I don't think anyone is happy with the outcome, but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one to blame. At least thats what I keep telling myself.","The tourism industry is in a state of flux  . Countries are competing for tourists by investing in their holiday destinations and thus making them more attractive and diverse. However, tourism needs to be carefully managed to prevent harm to the environment and disruption to local communities and its economy. The possible disadvantages of tourism on the one hand and new types of sustainable tourism on the other are discussed and contextualised in the two extracts. \n" +
            "The issues touched upon in the first text are threefold: important projects for local communities might be sidelined as the focus is on infrastructure developments for tourists, the situation in environmental problem zones may be exacerbated by, for example, water cycle damage and on top of that, the profits of tourism often are not for the benefit of the local population. Instead global players such as hotels or airlines walk off with their pockets full. \n" +
            "The flaws of tourism are contrasted by trends such as eco-tourism  which aims at reducing the impact that tourism has on naturally beautiful environments. Eco-tourism is based upon the idea that the natural environment and local communities are not exploited by tourism. All tourism projects are designed in cooperation with local communities. Infrastructure improvements have to benefit local inhabitants and not just tourists.\n" +
            "Tourism nowadays has to be seen in the context of climate change and declining natural resources. Some " +
            "remote islands or regions located on the shore may disappear in the forseeable future  due to rising sea levels. We should do our utmost to put off such a bleak scenario by travelling responsibly, avoiding long-distance flights as much as we can, protecting resources by not taking too many showers, eating local food and drink and not using air-conditioning into the bargain. It is about time we heed these guidelines. Otherwise we will be the ones experiencing the devastating consequences first hand.\n","Our society is going through a global tendency which encourages people to cook less and buy more of these  ready-made meals. The considerable growth in the consumption of convenience food has taken place not only in  UK but in many other countries, such us in Brazil. The reasons are all quite similar across these places. People lack time to cook their own meals, yet they are interested in trying other kinds of food and the prices are generally reasonable. However, should we stop cooking altogether?\n" +
            "The majority of people consider their lives to be too busy and cooking would not be a priority. These days most people work full-time and have many other responsibilities. Many people also have a misconception about the amount of time that is required in order to cook a simple and nutritious meal. There are a lot  dishes that can be done  with little time and with few ingredients. \n" +
            "Another benefit of cooking from scratch is that we are fully aware of what is in our food. Despite the delicious taste of these take-away meals, we hardly ever know how it is  cooked and the quality of ingredients. In order for the industry to make a profit, they will often choose the cheapest ingredients. As a result, these types of meals are often not very nutritious.\n" +
            "Lastly, we can save money by cooking our own meals. Even though the cost of ready-made meals are normally quite reasonable, still we will  always find ourselves saving money when we buy ingredients and cook at home. \n" +
            "In conclusion, it was acknowledged this  current tendency to buy convenience food which helps us through" +
            " our busy daily lives. However, it was also noted that we can largely benefit from cooking from scratch.","The trend of taking a gap year out from your current job or studies has vastly grown  since the 1990s. How come that more and more people make the leap: what jobs do they go for and what benefits do they reap? \n" +
            "Waiters or cashiers in fast-food restaurants are common jobs picked for a gap year. It is a real opportunity to gain customer-facing experience, to learn to work under pressure and of course to save money for future projects. A young and a flexible workforce appeals to employers which expect a high turnover in that sort of job. The experience can prove hard though, as working conditions including a sustained pace and regular late shifts may be poor. Eventually, the range of skills developed will certainly help you to stand out when applying for jobs in the service industry. \n" +
            "Volunteering for a charity, hospital or care home is another option for those looking for a more compassionate experience. It can be personally very rewarding as you may learn a great deal about yourself in helping others in need. If you intend to pursue a career in healthcare, it is also a real way of demonstrating your motivation when applying to school or university. The drawback is on the financial side since volunteering work is by definition not paid. \n" +
            "If a thirst for adventure is close to your heart, you might want to consider travelling. It doesn’t have to be far, we sometimes forget the travel experience can be right on your doorstep so it fits the bill for tight budgets. Going for an abroad option means an extra financial effort but you can get to know a different country, meet different people, improve your language skills and also more broadly learn how to get by in life. And most recruiters certainly appreciate candidates able to speak a foreign language. \n" +
            "All options have their pro and cons, but at  the end the best advisor is unmistakably yourself. " +
            "Ultimately, you probably won’t regret taking a gap year simply because you will not only enhance your CV but also gain maturity and many other useful life skills.\n","I have often asked myself whether it is different being a teenager nowadays than when I was that age. Are the problems still the same?\n" +
            "The years between 10 and 20 are certainly a difficult time in everybody's life because one’s personality is developing and this makes a teenager generally more vulnerable than an adult. I am convinced that when it comes to media it is demanding to deal with for young people today. Advertisements are very prominent in our modern world and teenagers normally spend a lot of hours watching television or surfing the internet, which makes them potential customers. Furthermore, many teenagers have more money to spend than maybe twenty years ago and you often hear about families taking loans for expenses like technical equipment or mobile phone bills for their children. Certainly in the current economic climate many parents face tough decisions especially when it comes to what they can afford for their offspring. The most important point is that teenagers are often an easy target for companies advertising their latest gadgets Many teenagers will buy it if theyjust manage to convince them that their product is an absolute ‘n'|ust—have', because the pressure of belonging to a certain group, feeling accepted and not being an outsider is a big issue for a young person.\n" +
            "On the other hand, teenagers are trend setters. They have to create new ideas to be unique orjust different from their own parents and this often sets the trend for a whole generation. Being special and fashionable is so important and therefore one needs to spend money on clothes, computers, games or phones to be part of your teenage generation and to find common grounds to make friends and have a fulfilling social life.\n" +
            "Personally, I find it quite shocking when reading about the psychological strategies advertising companies use to gain influence on young people to sell a product. They are also often exploiting the creative energy of teenagers and it is almost impossible to escape the world of advertisement.\n" +
            "To conclude, I believe it is not feasible to prohibit adverts for teenagers. Furthermore, parents cannot" +
            " avoid their children coming into contact with it, but it needs sensible adults helping and supporting teenagers in developing their own personality and sense of taste without the powerful influence of adverts.\n","These texts both deal with the relationship between teenagers and advertising.\n" +
            "The first one focuses on how advertisers exploit young people, taking advantage both of teenage preoccupation with the media and of their susceptibility to peer pressure combined with a wish to appear ‘cool'. The second text is less critical of the relationship between marketing and young people. It presents the young as having a very positive influence on the quality of modern adverts, helping to make them much wittier and more original than ever before. This text maintains that teenagers‘ impact on advertising derives partly from their predilection for what is intriguingly new but also, more particularly, from their own creative energy.\n" +
            "This energy has been channeled into advertising, raising it arguably to the level of an art form.\n" +
            "While l appreciate the arguments put forward in both texts, ltend to feel more in sympathy with the approach of the first one. l suspect that advertisers are quite cold—hea rtedly prepared to exploit the youth market, keen to capture the attention - and the cash — of the new generation and well aware of how young people are perhaps more easily influenced than their more cynical elders.\n" +
            "I would accept that advertising can be very creative and l personally often find an advert in a magazine or a TV commercial attractive to look at or enjoyably humorous. lt does not seem unreasonable to suggest that many people with artistic talents are attracted into the advertising profession. However, I do not see that as having any direct connection with teenagers. Those who create the most original adverts are certainly likely to be young but in their twenties or early thirties rather than their teens. Moreover the appeal of the more sophisticated advert is surelyjust as powerful for the older generation as for teenagers.\n" +
            "\n","Amusement Park\n" +
            "I have recently visited an amusement park while on holiday. lt had many exciting features including a 5-D cinema, boating lake, electronic video games and rides of all sizes ranging from simple ones For children to much larger rides for thrill—seekers. The 5—D cinema is exciting as it is a relatively new technology and unavailable near me. A documentary about sharks was showing when l visited. The 5—D experience is amazing, and when things come out at you from the screen they look very realistic. When this happens it makes people scream, like they were on a rollercoaster. There are more rides than anything else at the park as this is the reason many people go - For the exhilarating experiences The larger rides have long queues and can take up to an hour to reach the front. The one that stood out for me was ‘The Extreme Drop‘, which shoots you up a steep track at about 100kph before pausing at the top where you look down for a few seconds at the ant-like people on the ground before hurtling towards them at an even greater speed. This ride has an incredible exhilarating rush and provides the loudest screams of any of the rides. There is a second queue for this ride which takes a little longer than the main one, but you get a seat right at the Front ofthe carriage. l would recommend joining this queue for any ride available as you get the best views and biggest adrenalin rush.\n" +
            "Amusement parks make a huge contribution to the quality of life for local residents. They not only " +
            "provide entertainment for the local residents, especially for young families during school holidays, they also bring jobs and money into the area. As well asjobs within the actual park, amusement parks help increase local tourism, which can provide a vast amount ofjobs in a variety of different areas for the local residents. This will then provide a lower rate of unemployment in the area and a higher standard of living for the local residents.","Motorsport is very big in my country, and the highlight of the motorsport calendar is the Formula 1 grand-prix held here every year. Formula 1 travels the world visiting about 15-2O countries a season, each country holding one grand-prix race. The whole event takes three days to complete and always follows the same format: Friday — Practice, Saturday — Qualiﬁng, Sunday — Race. 1O teams compete with 2 cars per team in the grand-prix.\n" +
            "First, second and third place all receive a trophy at the end of the race. All three days are broadcast on TV, but the highlight is the race itself, which has the largest viewership. The TV coverage improves each year as technology gets updated quicker than ever before. Every year there are always new innotive ways to show the race. This year there were cameras mounted on cars, cameras on zip—lines above corners to create unique angles and Z2-D cameras to capture the race as its never been seen before. Each year the broadcasters also try to improve the graphics displayed on the W screens with more and more detailed ‘Heads Up Displays’ (which are similar to the HUD used in video games) of what the drivers are doing in the car, so the viewers can see where, when and how much a driver is breaking, changing gear or accelerating. Viewers can also hear conversations between drivers and their pit-crew. All of this makes the viewer feel closer to the action and like they are involved in the race.\n" +
            "As motorsport is very prominent in my country the grand-prix has been used to show off not only new " +
            "technology, but also the national pride within the country. Irrespective of whether any of the competitions are from here, we celebrate F1 as a nation, and are proud that the race is held here. This is greatly helped by TV coverage always pushing boundaries and the fact that many people in the country will be doing the same thing at the same time. lt gives you the sense of unity.\n","Dear Editor,\n" +
            "I was interested to read your recent feature on young people's participation in voluntary projects. l was impressed by the way in which the volunteers had not only provided valuable help for those less fortunate than themselves but had also gained a great deal themselves from the experience. They had blossomed as people and had often clariﬁed their own career aspirations as a result of the work they had been involved in.\n" +
            "I should like to suggest a couple of other projects that I think it would be beneficial for youngsters to volunteer on. The first is a programme for schoolchildren with learning difficulties. Cuts in funding mean that this will have to close down unless volunteers can help to run it. It has been an enormously successful programme, helping many youngsters to develop skills that will stand in good stead throughout their lives, and it would be a great pity were it forced to fold.\n" +
            "The second is an environmental project keeping the forests around our town in good order. Work there involves clearing away dead wood, planting new trees when necessary and tidying paths and picnic areas. The forest is a valuable resource for city dwellers and maintaining it in good order is of great benefit to the public as well as to the flora and fauna of the forest.\n" +
            "Taking part in these projects would teach teenagers new skills — helping children with disabilities to learn, for example, or caring for the environment. However, more importantly perhaps, doing so would expand those young people's horizons making them aware of aspects of life which were previously almost certainly little known to them. Contributing to society through such voluntary work will help youngsters to develop a sense of responsibility towards the world they live in. All of this should prove of considerable value in future years both to them as individuals and to society as a whole.\n" +
            "Yours faithfully,\n" +
            "Pedro.","Back in the day when I was in high school the curriculum was clear cut; it ranged from languages to economics and mathmatics  with some sport activities in the middle. All were supposed to prepare you for what was to come after graduation; grown up life. But did they really? Who of you was truly ready for social interaction or handling their personal finance, not me I can tell you! No, if I would have had  a say in it, the subjects under discussion in the classroom they would have been much closer to life.\n" +
            "One thing I was not prepared for but which proved to be a vital part of my entire adult life was how to handle my personal finance. Some bits and pieces were touched upon during economics class but none of the teachers really explained the pitfalls of abankloan or a credit card, how to balance income and expenses each month and what the effect of a variable interest rate is on your morgage .\n" +
            "Another worldly subject which schools should spend more time on is social interaction. At school you are surrounded by peers and teachers but that does not prepare you for things like your first job application. I still have vivid memories of mine; I was totally under-dressed, way to cocky and not nearly respectful enough to the person conducting the interview. Needless to say I did not get the job! For this reason alone social behaviour should be much higher on the agenda of schools but don't forget the other social events we have to deal with over and over again like parties, business events, etc. Who wouldn't want to be the centre of attention at a party? If only some lessons in small talk would have prepared us.\n" +
            "A final matter, and maybe the most important one, is our health. We have all read the global reports on overweight children, adults dying of cardiac failure, the list goes on and on. So why is there no focus on a healthy lifestyle at school already? Not only could it save thousands of lives but it would also save millions in healthcare annually. Just teaching kids to pay attention to their intake of fat, sugar, salt, additives, etc. would mean a world of difference. In combination with sports this could hugely improve the lives of future generations, and who knows, we might actually finally be able to become 150 years old! All thanks to a new and improved curriculum.","A packet of crisps lying on the floor, a half-eaten pizza on the coffee table and lots of CDs, DVDs and video games all over the place, is all that parents see every time we get home from work. Although there was a time when parents used to worry about where their siblings would be, nowadays we are more concerned about the fact that our teenager children spend so much time at home.\n" +
            "But, why a generation who should be thinking about playing truant, spending all day with their friends and doing sports, decide to spend so many hours at home?\n" +
            "Here, we have to look at new technologies. Not only have they been crucial in the development of medicine or the motor industry but they have also led to a changing in youngsters' social lives. They are surrounded by so many devices that can entertain them that why should they leave home? While previous generations had just one TV set at home, two at the most, nowadays there is such a variety of options that teenagers would need a 25-hour day in order to enjoy their computers, cd players, dvd players, video games or mp3s -whatever they are.\n" +
            "However, is technology the one which has to be blame for that? I don't think so. First of all, parents have all the responsibility in this matter. After a tiring working day it is much easier to let children be educated by TV while we are having a bubble bath or drinking a cup of wine by the fireplace. But, hard as it might be, we should try to do things with them in order to develop a liking for sports and a healthy life, which would be so important in their future. Moreover, why not paying them the registration fee in a sports club, instead of buying a Playstation when they get good marks at school?\n" +
            "Lets do something before it is to late...\n" +
            "...oops! 7 p.m., time for my favourite TV programme, which I will watch for the next 3 hours while having dinner -I don't remember the last time we ate at the dining table!-, after TV maybe a bit of the Internet... Ouch, what an awful backache! I should join a gym,... next month perphaps…","Dear Sir/Madam,\n" +
            "I have read the letter entitled 'Merging cultures-can it be stopped?', which appeared in Monday's edition of your newspaper and I was very pleased to see that other readers were invited to give their opinions on the subject.\n" +
            "Although I am an eighteen year-old student I have been all over Europe and have heard the opinion of many teenagers concerned with this problem. It is obvious that American culture has gained popularity in the past fifty years due to so many fields of activity that are being dominated by Americans. Nevertheless, European kidsin my generation are turning their back on American culture and displaying a much greater enthusiasm for European culture than their elders.\n" +
            "Home-grown youth culture is the unifying force of the new generation. People watch US films, but do not consider the US or its culture the source of all inspiration. European kids listen to music, wear French and Italian jeans and also enjoy the particularities of European culture. When they do look beyond Europe it is to the East or the Orient. They seem to be extremely interested in the Oriental culture. In this case it seems clear to me that there is still hope for places with centuries-old cultural traditions.\n" +
            "On the other hand, there are already many spots - that were once considered 'exotic' - on the verge of becoming a cultural desert. On one of my journeys - to the Middle East - I visited the city of Jeddah, a wonderful combination of old and new, sense of history and rapid development. Surprisingly enough, people here didn't just thought of the city's modernization, they were also concerned with the preservation of the old city. On one side there was the old town with its strange odors and sounds of the old shopping streets, and on the other there was this whole new occidental-like city with big shopping malls. It was just amazing to see it all in front of your eyes, like history speeded up on one side and yet at the same time, what stayed the same was what retained.\n" +
            "Surely there can be a wide range of cultural influences, but I cannot entirely agree that cultures are merging into one. There is still that feeling of culture shock when visiting a foreign country.","Based on a discussion by members of the training department, about whether or not the department should replace classroom - based training with online training, this proposal has been written.\n" +
            "1. Benefits from online training\n" +
            "Establishing online training, which would replace classical classroom - based training, would reduce training costs to a minimum. Not only costs in the form of teachers' salaries but also hiring rooms, paying electricity and studying materials would be dropped.\n" +
            "Online training is preferred to the classroom for its flexibility as well. Those who would take part in it would appreciate the chance of accessing it at any time of day according to their possibilities.\n" +
            "Online training is evidently the most prefered way of learning for it does not require any travelling costs and is very convenient. Considering that it is accessible from home, it saves much time for those who are busy travelling from meeting to meeting.\n" +
            "2. Online training disadvantages\n" +
            "In spite of the fact that online training is a very modern and favourite way of supplying with information,  it may carry certain disadvantages. Setting it up can be very expensive. A well elaborated programme with a plan for studying must be worked out.\n" +
            "In addition to paying big sum of money to programators, the way of learning itself could evoke negative reaction by learners.\n" +
            "Even if the employees welcomed new, modern ways of training they may not have computers at home. This fact would increase costs considerably.\n" +
            "Moreover, the company must decide which skills are suitable for learning online. Obviously, some skills require life discussions and immediate contact with the trainer.\n" +
            "Recommendations\n" +
            "The best way to set up a new, valuable and also quality training programme is to combine both online and classroom one. The suggestion, based on successful experience, is to start training which would consist of online training - 80 per cent - and classroom training - 20 per cent. Employees would be present at sessions that would take one and half hour every two weeks.\n" +
            "Improving the company's image\n" +
            "Improving the company's image is the aim of each firm. New, modern as well as favourite ways of training employees will improve the image of the company. Those employees, who take part in training and do not own computers are supposed to be supplied to them by the company itself. Taking this action helps improving the good name of the company. Last but not least, the employees can be offered the chance to buy the computers they were borrowed by deducting the cost from their salary.","The improbable happened twice\n" +
            "When it comes to school years it is hard to point out only one or two memories. There are so many to choose; those were times of joy, fun and lots of adventures. I am going to tell you about my best and worst school memories.\n" +
            "Let us travel back to 1990 when I was in 7th grade. I used to sit at the back of the classroom, spend whole lessons with parallel talking, drawing and daydreaming a lot. Believe it or not I also had really good grades and the appreciation of most teachers. At that year especifically was hold a huge contest where students would compete among other grades solving math marathons, geography projects and even gathering items from anywhere in the town such as a special fruit or the oldest person (who had to be convinced to come to our presentation). Some tasks would only be published at the last day and demanded a lot of team work, union and a little bit of luck. The least probable result came with the announcement of the best cheer team, foreign language song audition and creative presentation. Although it was not expected, we beat the seniors brilliantly. \"Equiperalta\" made history and would never be forgotten.\n" +
            "My worst memory took place in my last high school year during preparation for the CEE (college entrance exam). We were having the external games and were hosting Salesiano students from Recife. It was Saturday morning, when the boring English lesson was taking place that was happening the great handball final us against recife. How could I miss it? How could anyone dare not to be there? It was with no regret that I skipped the English lesson not returning from our break and running straight to the stadium in order to cheer for them. Our buddies playing against those conceited guys so fond of themselves, our most terrible rivals ever since. So I was there the whole match, cheering. I saw the Principal, the feared Mario Sergio on the other side, and he blinked to me. I was trying to get out among the crowd when I heard that ice tuned voice: 'What are you doing in here? Don`t you have lessons?' I smiled and replied: 'I guess the same thing you are ... cheering for our team.' He said: 'You must not come on Monday. I tried to explain myself telling him it was an English lesson but that just made things worse. He continued: so Ms Talita you are assuming you are skipping two lessons on purpose. You are suspended for four lessons. My world fell apart, I would miss the fearful chemistry mid term test and would be obliged to take it orally, that was just NOT fair.\n" +
            "Well, I had to struggle with chemistry a little bit but it was worth the game that we won at the last few minutes and I had not learnt my lesson, neither did I forget the Principal's ironic smile nor injustice. Many years after that I would again skip lessons at college, those ones considered meaningless, for joining a surfing contest. Do you want to know the consequences? I got first place.","Both texts discuss the topic of stress at work. This essay aims to summarise and evaluate the impact of stress at work at both company and individual levels.\n" +
            "The first text focuses on the consequences of stress at work from a company’s perspective. It stresses the financial impact, which at £26bn a year is enormous. It does mention that stressed employees have a direct, negative impact on company’s productivity, customer satisfaction and market perception. It is also said that employers must urgently take the necessary actions to increase their awareness of employees’ well-being and tackle seriously the topic of stress and mental illness at work. However, nothing is mentioned about how to do so. For instance, involving individuals in stress management workshops could efficiently address this issue.\n" +
            "The second text deals with the importance for individuals to talk when they suffer from stress. The main concern here is the well-being of individuals rather than the financial considerations of the first text. It is said to ask for help in talk with a family member or a trustworthy professional, which seems a sensible advice. The text also made a point about the many ways to cope with stress once it has been diagnosed and that accepting help and support to go through a difficult time must not be seen as sign of weakness. I completely agree with that and think we all need at some point in our lives external support and recognising this can only make things easier.\n" +
            "To sum up, I think stress at work should be tackled at the root i.e. at an individual level first. To do so, effective training on how to deal with stress such as workshops could certainly help. Once a trustworthy atmosphere allowing people to speak up about stress at work is created, then come the time where companies reap the benefits of taking care of their employees.","The term ‘society’ describes a group of people having something in common – a birdwatchers’ society shares a pastime, society in a more general rather more sociological sense shares a set of values. So, by definition, a certain degree of conformity is needed: If no-one adhered to such values (or nobody shared the pastime) there would be no society. However, conforming to social norms, meant to uphold the values, requires these to be meaningful and the meaning of norms will change just like the people making up a society will change. After all, the norms are just a reflection of the people living according to them. Consequently, adherence for adherence’s sake is wrong and this is where individuality comes into play. Norms have to be critically reviewed, lest they become stifling. So indeed, conformity does not bring about progress. Yet individuality has to take into account others’ individuality as well, that is to say, one’s own ends where that of others begins. While this limits the degree of individuality of any single person within a society, it allows society to exist as such in the face of individuality. Just as individuality – being, being treated as and seeing oneself as an individual – is vital for a person’s health, so it is for society, which should be made up of healthy individuals. Older individuals might disagree with younger ones about which values bear which weight or indeed about which values they share at all. This might be due to values having changed between the time when the older ones were raised and ‘imprinted’ with values and the time when that was the case for younger ones. But it might also be that the actual values (norms) haven’t changed that much but are rather expressed differently. Most of the time, norms drift rather than leapfrog towards new meaning. Still, the perception is a disagreement. The rise of electronic equipment in public places illustrates this. Whereas older people might consider it unacceptable, it\n" +
            "is normal for younger ones. Yet at the heart of the matter is not the issue whether such devices are used or not but how – sensitively and with respect for others, or not. And I think that most people would agree that sometimes they do not want to be disturbed – and that is the value that is still shared. In everyday life, such disagreement can only be resolved by communicating. Communication is a two-way process and, as such, requires understanding, awareness and respect for other people’s views.","How should we behave in society? Should we follow social norms or should we use our own individual judgement to decide what is the appropriate way to conduct ourselves?\n" +
            "Some people find it very important to obey the rules of etiquette, to do what others consider proper. There are people – often the older generation – who get very upset when others do not follow social conventions, when they, for example, speak loudly on mobile phones in public places or lick their fingers or queue jump.\n" +
            "However, it should be noted that the things that irritate people will vary from one society to the next;\n" +
            "the rules of queue behavour, for instance, are very different in London, Moscow and Istanbul, and how it is acceptable to use a mobile phone differs considerably from one society to the next. Similarly, it is important to remember that social conventions change over time. It was once considered improper to eat on the street but now no-one pays the slightest attention to someone walking along munching a sandwich or an apple. The key to avoiding conflict, it seems, is imaginative empathy.\n" +
            "In general, it is counter-productive to worry too much about what the socially acceptable way to behave might be in any given situation. It can stop you thinking about what is the moral way to behave as you may become more focused on what is ‘proper’ rather than on what is right. You can also start suppressing your own important individuality and originality as you become unhealthily anxious about what others might be thinking.\n" +
            "The rules that do not – and should not – change are those regarding behaviour that has an effect on others. Dropping litter, for example, or pushing someone out of the way should always be condemned as inappropriate behaviour.","One of my favourite childhood books is the ‘Six Bullerby Children’ written by Astrid Lindergren, a famous Swedish author.The story is set in a three-farm remote village of Bullerby in Sweden.\n" +
            "The narrator is a seven-year-old girl, Lisa who, with her parents and two older brothers - Lasse and Bosse, lives in one of the houses. Lisa describes the daily life of the children in Bullerby which – contrary to what one might think when imagining life in a small, remote village – is far from boring. The children have plenty of funnyi deas, which often lead to amusing adventures.\n" +
            "Although the book was included in the compulsory school literature when I was a child (which often meant long, boring reads), I have truly enjoyed the adventures of Lisa and her friends. Despite very limited resources (the story is set in 1930s when children did not have many toys, not to mention a TV or video games!) the children always come up with exciting games or things to play with. This is something I admired and wished I could do when reading the book.\n" +
            "Another thing which appealed to me as a child was the natural childlike way in which Lisa (or Astrid Lindgren, the author) could tell the story connecting effortlessly with the young readers.\n" +
            "Despite the environment in which the children live nowadays has changed considerably since 1930s, children will always be children and if the book has appealed to so many young generations since it was published, I believe it will retain its impact. It can be more, even more relevant today, when children are presented with things to play, instead of inventing games themselves. Reading the book could definitely wake up their innate creativity.\n" +
            "‘Six Bullerby Children’ could, however, also be more relavent to adults who would like to either ‘return’ to their childhood for a little while, or be able to connect with their own children a bit better.","Recent Jobs Fair\n" +
            "Last weekend there was a Jobs Fair in the Town Hall. Over 100 different international companies and organisations had stands giving information about the careers they can offer young people. There were plenty people on each stand to answer questions and to give advice and there was also a wealth of promotional literature available, The Fair also arranged a series of work-related talks, films and other events in the course of the weekend.\n" +
            "Promotions of particular interest\n" +
            "All in all it was an excellent event. There were two stands that I personally found particularly interesting and relevant. The first was one promoting opportunities for language teaching abroad. This is something that I and a number of fellow-students have been seriously considering. We were able to find out there about what qualifications we would need, what kind of working conditions we could expect and where there might be interesting vacancies for us to apply for.\n" +
            "The second stand that drew my particular attention was one for a charity offering young people opportunities to gain experience of other countries and cultures while helping on a range of voluntary projects abroad. These projects included medical, environmental, construction and educational work in a number of different countries. I was able to talk to several young people who had already participated in such work and gained a very positive impression of the benefits of taking part.\n" +
            "Value of such events\n" +
            "In my opinion such events are of great benefit to young people. They inform us about opportunities that we might not otherwise have known about. They expand our horizons in terms of what we can aspire to. Several of my friends, for example, left the event feeling that their career plans had been transformed by what they have discovered during the Jobs Fair. We all agreed that our eyes had been opened to new opportunities in a very valuable way.","The Scottish writer, Robert Louis Stevenson, used to say that he travelled ‘not to go anywhere but to go.’ In other words he loved travelling for its own sake. Although I enjoy being at a new destination, I agree that the journey there can be the most exciting and rewarding part of any holiday.\n" +
            "Some years ago I studied Russian at university and used to travel frequently to Russia. I usually went by train, by far the cheapest way to get there then. This involved a three-day train journey across the Channel and then over the North European Plain through Belgium, Germany, Poland and Byelorus to Moscow. The train from Ostend was a Russian one and once on board you felt as if you were already in Russia, especially as you poured yourself a glass of tea from the samovar at the end of each carriage and made yourself comfortable for the two nights you’d spend in your sleeping compartment.\n" +
            "I loved the sense of gradually making my way into a different world. Towns and villages became less frequent and fields turned into forests as we chugged eastwards. The children who waved at the train as it passed began to have high Slav cheekbones. Travelling slowly gives you time to savour the gradual changes, to think about where you’re going or where you’ve just been, to adapt to a new way of being. This opportunity to reflect is immensely enriching.\n" +
            "These days it’s cheaper to hop on a plane than a train and you can now get to Russia in three hours instead of three days. Lunch in London and dinner in Moscow has become possible thanks to the jet engine. In many ways the journey could be seen as easier now. But in my opinion travelling by rail is still much more satisfying, providing a real sense of the distance – both geographical and social - between different countries.","With the rapid pace in which technology has been developing over the last decades, air travel has become more and more affordable to the hoi polloi. This is particularly true since the spread of the ‘no-frills’ airlines which have taken over Europe by storm. Air travel offers relatively cheap and fast journey to its passengers, which explains its recent rise. But are these journeys pleasant ones? Recent opinion polls show they are not. People are unhappy about the weight and size limits on luggage, numerous changes, stress related to queues to check-in, security and then to the gate . . . . The largest ache for air passengers, however, seems to be the lack of human interaction amid the ‘dehumanising feel’ of the airports.\n" +
            "I recently had an opportunity – and a pleasure – to travel by train to a family wedding in Germany. Despite the fact the journey took 6 hours longer than it would by plane, it was a truly enjoyable experience. The rail track passed through beautiful, green mountain valleys, offering amazing views of numerous castles perched on the mountain sides and the views of medieval towns. I have also met a few very nice local people who entertained me during the journey with interesting and funny stories of their family weddings.\n" +
            "Thanks to excellent views and the people I travelled with, the journey felt unbelievably short. There are many advantages of travelling long distances by train, most of which overweight the largest disadvantage to some – namely the length of the journey. First of all – one is able to meet interesting people and engage in long conversations – a train journey seems to be a more welcoming environment for social interaction than a quick flight is. Secondly, whilst passing through the towns and villages rather than flying over them one is able to better experience the culture. There are also practical advantages – like the lack of strict luggage restrictions, less queues and the ability to open the window to get some fresh air. There are also less problems with the leg space and a possibility to stretch them by strolling to the restaurant carriage or up and down the train.\n" +
            "To conclude, train travel could lead to a better travel experience comparing to the aircraft, under the condition that the passenger is open to experiencing the journey and is able to sacrifice a bit more time travelling.","‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep’ by Philip K Dick is a title of profound implications, able to sparkle the interest of the average reader.\n" +
            "The Plot\n" +
            "The story follows the life and experiences of Rick Deckard who works for the San Francisco Police Department on a journey of self-discovery through the landscapes of a post-apocalyptic Earth. A couple of decades ago there was a major nuclear catastrophe that has gradually reduced Earth to a pile of contaminated rubble. Most animal species are extinct and a vast percentage of the population has emigrated to the newly-colonized planet Mars. Those left behind have no choice but to continue their lives as best as possible enduring the radioactivity still eminent in the atmosphere. Emigrants to Mars are given specially-designed Androids which are human-like robots to aid them in the planet’s hostile conditions. Deckard’s official capacity is bounty hunter with the job of hunting down escaped Androids from Mars in order to ‘retire’ them before causing harm to humans.\n" +
            "Title meaning and importance\n" +
            "The title of the novel asks the rhetoric question of whether these outwardly human robots are capable of dreaming and having emotions in the form that their human masters are. This theme is developed as Deckard undergoes profound changes regarding his attitude towards Androids, ultimately abandoning his former cynical approach in favour of a more tolerating view of them. The distinction between human beings and Androids grows increasingly terbid and towards the end Deckard takes a compassionate view of the Androids in terms of their plight which is solely man’s creation. It highlights that we may, in the not so distant future, manufacture robots that might be dangerously close to humans in their resemblance of them.\n" +
            "Title’s application to the story\n" +
            "The title clearly reflects major premises of the story, such as the thin line between humans and their robotic creations. There are many surreal moments during which Androids even seem like human beings in their reactions but they cannot escape their fate and must succumb to the horrible facts of their existence. So the question in the title is arguably a concrete negative one, but is meant to be addressed in a philosophical way. ‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep’ is very captivating at times and the reader can identify with the characters and their respective struggles. Its title carries with it a resonance able to draw the reader’s attention.","Dear Chariman\n" +
            "I am writing with regard to the campaign that you are promoting in favour of an international sports competition that could be hosted in my town.\n" +
            "As a matter of fact Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition, which will last one day.\n" +
            "Venice is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Italy. The marataonets coming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city, which offers a great deal of facilities.\n" +
            "There are two separate communication networks in the city, that of the waterways and that of the narrow streets. Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night. The main centre can be reached very easily. Despite the private service is very expensive it is efficient.\n" +
            "Four and five star hotels are located in the main area, but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available to families.\n" +
            "Hotel receptions and travel agencies are always ready to help their guests with a wide range of information on the city's entertainments, exhibitions and so on.\n" +
            "Sightseeing and excursions with private local guides are available on request.\n" +
            "In addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres, cinemas and night-clubs.\n" +
            "On the contrary, participants will find a wide range of restaurants, trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food. Some of these restaurants can be quite expensive.\n" +
            "In conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants.\n" +
            "Yours faithfully,\n" +
            "Pedro.","Dear Sir\n" +
            "I am writing with the reference to the article in the January edition of \"Future Net\", which predicts that in the foreseeable future electronic books will replace printed ones. Obviously, electronic book is no longer the stuff of science fiction. E-book boom is under way. I am concerned with this matter and feel involved in this digital revolution.\n" +
            "Undoubtedly, electronic book provides several advantages over traditional book. Firstly, book in digital format offers today's readers additional opportunities such as a keyword search, retrival of information. Another advantage is that doing index look-ups on digital book is very fast process so e-book is likely to become a perfect reference tool. Besides, e-book has one more advantage, especially to distance learners or people living in outlying areas without access to large libraries, which lies in e-book's availability by dial up access.\n" +
            "Indeed, e-book has some disadvantages and its concept is still foreign to the general public. Firstly, computer software is needed for reading e-books. Moreover, there are some difficulties in reading on screen with poor resolution, a problem not expected to be solved in the near future. The poor resolution hurts eyes and makes online reading less enjoyable compared to traditional books.\n" +
            "The importance of printed books must not be overlooked, particularly when it comes to reading for pleasure. Book lovers like holding a nicely bound book, flipping pages, enjoying its touch and smell. Most readers like putting hardbacks on bookshelves and watch their personal library growing. So, printed books have enormous advantages. But on the other hand, we should keep in mind the problem of deforestation since many forests are being cut down for the paper industry.\n" +
            "Will e-book mean the end of printed books? Personally, I am convinced that the bound books have a future. So, let's don't say goodbye to a hardcover yet. Even under the best circumstances, it will take years before you see e-books on every street corner. Nobody knows if the majority will take to digitized reading. As for me, I much prefer printed books over digital ones. If I want to read some fiction, I'd rather curl up with a good old paperback. I don't share opinion about printed book's extinction In my opinion, traditional books will survive, just as radio survived TV, and the film lived on after video. They will continue to amuse, influence and impress for centuries.\n" +
            "I am a dedicated reader of your magazine and I hope you will take my views into account in the future editions of your magazine.\n" +
            "Yours faithfully,\n" +
            "Elena Borzova.","This sounds too much like the old \"man playing God\" trope: we don't know, therefore we should continue to revel in our ignorance instead of taking any risks. To hell with that, if I can give my children genes that prevent debilitating diseases and low intelligence and if the risks are manageable, I will take that. That possibility is decades away, but it's a worthy goal to pursue.\n" +
            "This is not about \"designer babies\" in the eye color or physical appearance sense - who knows what will be the beauty norm 50 years from now. It's about ridding humanity of what we know is deadly and, on a personal level, preventing my own bad genes getting passed on. I have a bad back, an insatiable appetite and high cholesterol, I'm balding and have a slight heart deformity. Should I pass those traits along just for the hope that someday some bald distant sibling will have immunity from a future plague? I don't think I'm really responsible for that, it's the task of future generations to keep the baldness genes in a bank or database and use it at that time if they find them useful.\n" +
            "The reduced genetic diversity is moot - people of all ethic groups have today a chance to reproduce instead of being wiped out like for most part of human history. We are in an explosion of genetic diversity, even very dangerous traits are being preserved in the gene pool due to the advances of medicine that made them survivable. When genetic editing will be so widespread as to threaten the genetic diversity of the human species, we will be living in a Star Trek egalitarian paradise, it's very presumptuous to think we have any foresight into such a future.","I live in Japan and actually live in rural enough area that there is no train. Well, there was a train until 1968 when the bus company convinced the fishermen that the reduced fish stocks were due to the train scaring away the fish (not over fishing, of course!). Now there are no fish and no train.\n" +
            "Before I extol the virtues of the train system in Japan, there is one thing that you have to understand first. It is expensive compared to transit services in many North American cities. As far as I know, it's not subsidised by government, so you have to pay the full cost. The main rail system is owned by Japan Rail, but they are operated by individual companies -- each with a monopoly in their own area. Additionally, there are \"private\" train companies that both own the lines and run the trains. If you live in a very rural area (and it wasn't screwed over by the bus companies), you will almost certainly be using these private lines. If you want to go to a big city, it usually means that you have to transfer. Luckily the payment options are almost completely harmonised -- at least on the regional level. You can get pre-paid cards that work for all the companies in your region (with a very few exceptions).\n" +
            "I live in Shizuoka prefecture. To take the bus a distance of about 30 km it costs about $10 US (also not subsidised). To take the train, it's a bit cheaper (about $7). If you take intercity busses, the relationship switches. A 200 km bus trip costs about $30, while the train will cost about $50. However, the intercity busses only travel about 4 times a day, while the trains come every 15 minutes.\n" +
            "The main difference between the train and the bus is convenience and speed. The trains are quite fast. I often travel to Hamamatsu city from Kanaya city by train. Due to circumstances, my wife goes by car. I beat her every single time -- sometimes by hours. By car, there are lots of unexpected events: accidents, traffic jams, etc. On the train, there are very few -- really just suicide attempts and I haven't seen one in our area for years.","In Japan the trains are on time. Very, very, very occasionally the train will be 1 minute late. Once a year it will be 2 or more minutes late. Seriously, if the train is not on the platform 30 seconds before the scheduled departure time, people are looking at their watches in disbelief.\n" +
            "Part of this is because the trains are set up so that freight is generally able to pass and be passed. On private, rural lines, there is never any freight (though the trains often carry mail). Also the trains are all in good shape. I've literally never been on a train in Japan that broke down. When I lived just outside of London, the trains would break down every week at least. One of the other main points is that theft in Japan is virtually unheard of. When I lived in the UK, I heard that one of the reasons the signalling constantly broke down is because people would steal the copper cables for scrap. Culturally, this just doesn't happen in Japan, so it's a consideration you have to keep in mind if you want to emulate Japan's success with trains.\n" +
            "While my wife has a car, I don't like using it. If we go anywhere, it's usually by bus and then by train. It's only if we need a car at the other end that we use the car (for example, when we go to Hamamatsu, my wife takes the car so that she can take her mother shopping, etc). Because there is no train where I live, I end up always taking the bus.\n" +
            "Even though Japan is a country where punctuality is almost taken for granted, busses are not punctual. They suffer from the same problems that happen everywhere -- busses are really hard to predict. Sometimes the road is clear, and sometimes it is not. The busses usually end up being virtually randomly timed by the time they end up in the middle of their route. I almost always miss my connection at the train station. Because the bus comes every hour or so, it means I usually have to plan very carefully to ensure that I arrive on time. Often I end up arriving an hour early just to make sure I get there on time.","For this and many other reasons, San Francisco is an amazing place for senior citizens, rich or poor. (There's a ridiculous number of senior housing and community centers, mostly invisible to people not in the know.) But the mass transit system sucks for working commuters because the system is biased towards the needs of the elderly.\n" +
            "And I mean it. I cajoled my mother to move here in 2011. She finally sold her car last year. For awhile she worked at a community center that provided free lunches to seniors, where several very wealthy seniors from Marin commuted into the city to eat alongside and converse with very poor seniors, simply because they wanted and needed the company.\n" +
            "Interestingly, San Francisco is (or was) being sued by HUD for racial discrimination. The supposedly most liberal large city in the country had a housing system that segregated people by ethnicity--senior housing projects tended to be Russian, Chinese, Latino, black, white, etc. Except for black areas, this was pretty much self-segregation. I don't know the extent to which the city perpetuated it, but they didn't seem to try to do anything to change it. (There's a waitlist system for senior housing and the seniors, at least, seemed to assume that people of the appropriate ethnicity were bumped, depending on the neighborhood. But I think mostly it simply had to do that seniors--and people generally--find their way to public assistance through their social networks, and different social networks will tend to channel people to particular programs and outlets.).","Armed in the sense of with a firearm, tazer or similar? Yeah, you're right, only a minority of British cops are qualified for that and most wouldn't have them anyway unless they need them.\n" +
            "But keep in mind in the UK all weapons are prohibited. Walking down the street waving a baseball bat in a threatening manner is a criminal offence in the UK. Any object that could reasonably be interpreted as a weapon needs a lawful excuse to carry it in public, and a bunch of objects that violent people tend to fixate on are just outright banned, there aren't any excuses permitted for those, you just can't have them in public at all.\n" +
            "Thus having just the _same_ gear as the cop: pepper spray, an extensible baton and some hand cuffs, would get you in trouble here, never mind any sort of firearm.\n" +
            "\"Constable\" is the legal term used in UK law to refer to police officers and give them special powers or immunities. A Detective Chief Inspector is still a Constable by this meaning, so is a Special Constable (volunteer spare time cop) but a Police Community Support Officer (cheaper fake cops with less training) is not a constable. Outside of statute law, ordinary people don't call them constables.\n" +
            "British pop culture says the equivalent of a \"get out of jail free\" card would be membership of a Masonic Lodge. Police officers (in particular senior ranks) are supposed to be particularly likely to join the Masons, an esoteric order with a big emphasis on helping other members.","Motion detectors within smartphones, like the accelerometer and the rotation-sensing gyroscope, could be prime tools for surreptitious data collection. They’re not permission protected — the phone’s user doesn’t have to give a newly installed app permission to access those sensors. So motion detectors are fair game for any app downloaded onto a device, and “lots of vastly different aspects of the environment are imprinted on those signals,” says Mani Srivastava, an engineer at UCLA.\n" +
            "For instance, touching different regions of a screen makes the phone tilt and shift just a tiny bit, but in ways that the phone’s motion sensors pick up, Mehrnezhad and colleagues demonstrated in a study reported online April 2017 in the International Journal of Information Security. These sensors’ data may “look like nonsense” to the human eye, says Al-Haiqi, but sophisticated computer programs can discern patterns in the mess and match segments of motion data to taps on various areas of the screen.\n" +
            "For the most part, these computer programs are machine-learning algorithms, Al-Haiqi says. Researchers train them to recognize keystrokes by feeding the programs a bunch of motion sensor data labeled with the key tap that produces particular movement. A pair of researchers built TouchLogger, an app that collects orientation sensor data and uses the data to deduce taps on smartphones’ number keyboards. In a test on HTC phones, reported in 2011 in San Francisco at the USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Security, TouchLogger discerned more than 70 percent of key taps correctly.\n" +
            "Since then, a spate of similar studies have come out, with scientists writing code to infer keystrokes on number and letter keyboards on different kinds of phones. In 2016 in Pervasive and Mobile Computing, Al-Haiqi and colleagues reviewed these studies and concluded that only a snoop’s imagination limits the ways motion data could be translated into key taps. Those keystrokes could divulge everything from the password entered on a banking app to the contents of an e-mail or text message.","Fadel points out that according to figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, only about 1 percent of refugees have access to higher education, compared to a global average of 34 percent, meaning that “hundreds of thousands of university-qualified students are unable to realize their potential.” The new program is a step toward expanding that access.\n" +
            "The initial program was made available to any qualified registered refugees, asylees, or other forcibly displaced people, Fadel says, as well as to qualified citizens of Jordan. The organizers made extra efforts to promote the program to women, and because access to records can be difficult for displaced people, applying to the program does not require transcripts or standardized test scores.\n" +
            "The program includes five online courses — two in computer science, and one each in data science, innovation, and leadership. The courses will be taught by a combination of MIT faculty and students, both live and on the edX platform.\n" +
            "The concept was initially created under the leadership of Admir Masic, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, who as a child was a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina whose family fled to a refugee camp in Croatia. He then lived in Germany and Italy, where he earned his college degrees. “I know firsthand that a good education is the ticket to a better life,” he says.\n" +
            "This initial program drew about 500 applicants, from 20 nations, including some as far from Jordan as Brazil and Japan. To make up for the lack of formal transcripts, the applicants were given special tests in math and English in order to qualify. They also submitted videos in which they described what they would do with a $100,000 investment if it were offered. The selected students came from four areas: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Occupied Territories. The initial class is composed of 50 percent women, as the organizers had hoped.","In conversation, people tend to express the same intent with different words, potentially over several sentences, and in various word orders. Unlike other chatbot-building platforms, Giant Otter uses “human-machine collaboration,” Orkin says, “to learn authentic variation in the way people express different thoughts, and to do it bottom-up from real examples.”\n" +
            "Giant Otter’s algorithms comb through anywhere from 50 to 100 transcripts from sales and customer support conversations, identifying language variations of the same intent, such as “How can I help you?” and “What’s your concern?” and “How may I assist you?” These are called “utterances.” All utterances are mixed around into chunks of test scripts for people to judge for accuracy online.\n" +
            "Consider a script for a sales call, where a salesperson is selling a product while the prospect is pushing for a discount. Giant Otter’s algorithms match and substitute one utterance in one script with a similar one from another script — such as swapping “I may be able to offer a discount” with “I’ll see if I can reach your price point.” That version is uploaded to Mechanical Turk or another crowdsourcing platform, where people will vote a “yes” or “no” if the substituted sentence makes sense.\n" +
            "In another human task, people break conversations into “events.” Giant Otter will lay out conversations horizontally and people will label different sections of the conversation. A salesperson saying, “Hello, thanks for contacting us,” for instance, may be labeled as “call opening.” Other section labels include “clarifying order,” “verifying customer information,” “proposing resolution,” and “resolving issue.”\n" +
            "“Between these two tasks, we learn a lot about the structure over how conversations unfold,” Orkin says. “Conversations break down into events, events break down into utterances, and utterances break down into many different examples of saying the same thing with different words.”\n" +
            "This builds a robust language database for chatbots to recognize anywhere from a few to more than 100 different ways to express the same sentiment — including fairly abstract variations. This is important, Orkin says, as today’s chatbots are built top-down, by a human manually plugging in various utterances. But someone seeking an order status update could say, for instance, “My order hasn’t come, and I checked my account, and it said to contact customer support.”\n","Giant Otter’s origin goes back to 2005, when Orkin joined the Cognitive Machines Group led by Deb Roy, an associate professor of media arts and sciences. Roy had just initiated the Human Speechome Project, his effort to gather data on how humans develop language by video and audio recording his newborn for three years.\n" +
            "Branching off from the project, Orkin developed The Restaurant Game, an online game that paired people online to have natural, text-based discussions as a customer and a waitress at a restaurant. “We hoped to get maybe 100 people to play. But not too long after [the game launched], we had data from 16,000 people,” Orkin says.\n" +
            "Many people would order food, pay bills, and talk about the menu. Others, however, were more unorthodox, asking the waitress on a date, stealing the cash register, or stacking cakes up to climb onto the roof. All of that data was valuable. “Whatever they did, we had all that data of natural conversations between players,” Orkin says. Soon, he hired people around the world through crowd-labor platforms, such as Mechanical Turk and Upwork, to ascribe context to the game’s transcripts.\n" +
            "The game turned into a platform to collect and curate dialog to make AI conversations more natural. In 2013, Orkin met Geoff Marietta, a Harvard Graduate School of Education student studying how virtual worlds could facilitate learning and improve relationships. Using Orkin’s platform, they developed a game called SchoolLife, where players assume roles of a bullying victim and a bystander. Players interacted with AI-controlled characters to come up with a solution to student conflict.\n" +
            "To commercialize the game, the two co-founded Giant Otter in 2013. For early support, Orkin turned to the MIT Venture Mentoring Service. Introductions through VMS have since led to a valuable partnership and potential pilot customers.\n" +
            "SchoolLife earned a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Science Foundation and was used in numerous schools in the region. But the budgeting cycles of school districts made it difficult for a startup to thrive in the education sector. Moreover, simulating bullying posed an issue, Orkin says. “With our platform, you need to capture data reflecting how people naturally converse. With bullying, we did come up with ways to record conversations from people role-playing in simulated scenarios, but it wasn’t authentic data,” Orkin says.\n","With billions of GPS devices in use today, people are beginning to take it for granted that services on their handheld devices will be location-aware.\n" +
            "But GPS doesn’t work well indoors, and it’s not precise enough for several potentially useful applications, such as locating medical equipment in hospitals or pallets of goods in warehouses, or helping emergency responders navigate unfamiliar buildings.\n" +
            "Professor of aeronautics and astronautics Moe Win has spent the last decade investigating the theory and practice of using wireless signals to gauge location. In 2010, his group published a series of papers deriving fundamental limits on the accuracy of systems that infer wireless transmitters’ locations based on features of their signals, such as power, angle of arrival, and time of flight.\n" +
            "In the February issue of the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Win and two colleagues — Wenhan Dai, an MIT graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics, and Yuan Shen, an associate professor of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University, who did his graduate work at MIT — expand on those results.\n" +
            "First, they show how changing a wireless localization system’s parameters — such as the power, bandwidth, and duration of its transmissions — alters the fundamental limits on its accuracy. This, in turn, allows them to determine the system configuration that yields the most accurate location inferences. They also provide practical localization algorithms that can approach those limits in real-world scenarios.\n" +
            "“We are developing a theory to determine the fundamental limits of location inference within different sets of constraints,” Win says. “In other words, what’s the best we can do with given resources? Based on the theory, we develop algorithms that approach these limits, and then we go into experimentation. The fact that we have the goal of going to experimentation means that the algorithms have to be as efficient as possible.”\n","The researchers’ theoretical approach assumes that the localization network consists of nodes with known positions, referred to as “anchors,” and nodes with unknown positions, referred to as “agents.” Wi-Fi access points distributed through an office building, for instance, could serve as anchors. Smartphones trying to determine their positions relative to the anchors would count as agents.\n" +
            "Within the theoretical framework, the goal is something the researchers call “node prioritization” — that is, determining which of the available anchors should transmit, at what power and with what range of frequencies and signal durations, in order to achieve a balance between localization accuracy and consumption of system resources. A solution that produced very accurate measurements by allowing an anchor to blast so loud and long that no other communication over the network was possible, for instance, would not be considered optimal.\n" +
            "The researchers’ theoretical analysis shows that the ability to adjust system parameters can consistently reduce localization error by 30 to 50 percent.\n" +
            "The key to the new paper is a geometric interpretation of the problem of choosing and configuring anchors. The metric that the researchers use to assess the accuracy of location inferences depends on three different characteristics of the location information extracted from wireless signals. As such, it defines a three-dimensional mathematical space, which turns out to be bullet-shaped.\n" +
            "The possible settings of all the anchors in the network also define a mathematical space, which is typically much larger. If the network has 20 anchors, then the corresponding settings define a 20-dimensional space. Win, Dai, and Shen, however, found a way to transform the high-dimensional space into a three-dimensional one: a polyhedron that represents all possible anchor configurations that meet certain resource constraints. Transposing both sets of data into the same three-dimensional space makes calculating the solution to the node prioritization problem much simpler and faster.\n" +
            "The problem becomes finding the bullet — a representation of the localization error metric — that intersects the polyhedron at exactly one point. This point represents the network configuration that will provide the most accurate location inference. If the bullet and the polyhedron don’t intersect at all, then the error measurement is unachievable. If they overlap, then the error measurement is not as low as it could be. Once the point of intersection has been identified, it can be mapped back on to the higher-dimensional space, where it represents particular anchor settings.\n","When it comes to processing power, the human brain just can’t be beat.\n" +
            "Packed within the squishy, football-sized organ are somewhere around 100 billion neurons. At any given moment, a single neuron can relay instructions to thousands of other neurons via synapses — the spaces between neurons, across which neurotransmitters are exchanged. There are more than 100 trillion synapses that mediate neuron signaling in the brain, strengthening some connections while pruning others, in a process that enables the brain to recognize patterns, remember facts, and carry out other learning tasks, at lightning speeds.\n" +
            "Researchers in the emerging field of “neuromorphic computing” have attempted to design computer chips that work like the human brain. Instead of carrying out computations based on binary, on/off signaling, like digital chips do today, the elements of a “brain on a chip” would work in an analog fashion, exchanging a gradient of signals, or “weights,” much like neurons that activate in various ways depending on the type and number of ions that flow across a synapse.\n" +
            "In this way, small neuromorphic chips could, like the brain, efficiently process millions of streams of parallel computations that are currently only possible with large banks of supercomputers. But one significant hangup on the way to such portable artificial intelligence has been the neural synapse, which has been particularly tricky to reproduce in hardware.\n" +
            "Now engineers at MIT have designed an artificial synapse in such a way that they can precisely control the strength of an electric current flowing across it, similar to the way ions flow between neurons. The team has built a small chip with artificial synapses, made from silicon germanium. In simulations, the researchers found that the chip and its synapses could be used to recognize samples of handwriting, with 95 percent accuracy.\n" +
            "The design, published today in the journal Nature Materials, is a major step toward building portable, low-power neuromorphic chips for use in pattern recognition and other learning tasks.\n" +
            "The research was led by Jeehwan Kim, the Class of 1947 Career Development Assistant Professor in the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, and a principal investigator in MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics and Microsystems Technology Laboratories. His co-authors are Shinhyun Choi (first author), Scott Tan (co-first author), Zefan Li, Yunjo Kim, Chanyeol Choi, and Hanwool Yeon of MIT, along with Pai-Yu Chen and Shimeng Yu of Arizona State University.\n","As a final test, Kim’s team explored how its device would perform if it were to carry out actual learning tasks — specifically, recognizing samples of handwriting, which researchers consider to be a first practical test for neuromorphic chips. Such chips would consist of “input/hidden/output neurons,” each connected to other “neurons” via filament-based artificial synapses.\n" +
            "Scientists believe such stacks of neural nets can be made to “learn.” For instance, when fed an input that is a handwritten ‘1,’ with an output that labels it as ‘1,’ certain output neurons will be activated by input neurons and weights from an artificial synapse. When more examples of handwritten ‘1s’ are fed into the same chip, the same output neurons may be activated when they sense similar features between different samples of the same letter, thus “learning” in a fashion similar to what the brain does.\n" +
            "Kim and his colleagues ran a computer simulation of an artificial neural network consisting of three sheets of neural layers connected via two layers of artificial synapses, the properties of which they based on measurements from their actual neuromorphic chip. They fed into their simulation tens of thousands of samples from a handwritten recognition dataset commonly used by neuromorphic designers, and found that their neural network hardware recognized handwritten samples 95 percent of the time, compared to the 97 percent accuracy of existing software algorithms.\n" +
            "The team is in the process of fabricating a working neuromorphic chip that can carry out handwriting-recognition tasks, not in simulation but in reality. Looking beyond handwriting, Kim says the team’s artificial synapse design will enable much smaller, portable neural network devices that can perform complex computations that currently are only possible with large supercomputers.\n" +
            "“Ultimately we want a chip as big as a fingernail to replace one big supercomputer,” Kim says. “This opens a stepping stone to produce real artificial hardware.”\n" +
            "This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation.\n","In 1996, when he was a high school senior in the small town of Cluny, in the Burgundy region of France, Philippe Rigollet applied to several of the two-year preparatory schools that most French students attend before moving on to university. His transcript reported a stellar math grade of 19.5 out of 20, but in the small space allotted for comments, his math teacher had written “fainéant.”\n" +
            "Rigollet translates that word as “slacker.”\n" +
            "“They were really looking for slackers in those preparatory schools,” Rigollet says. “They didn’t want people who were burned out at the end of high school and couldn’t push it, because it was much harder.”\n" +
            "“Slacker” is not an epithet that people tend to associate with MIT professors, and Rigollet was tenured in the Department of Mathematics last year. He is also part of MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. But in high school, Rigollet says, “I was not very disciplined about learning stuff I didn’t want to learn.”\n" +
            "Fortunately, there’s a lot that he has wanted to learn. His work is notable for its interdisciplinarity, moving back and forth between the fields of statistics and computer science and bringing insights from each to the other.\n" +
            "Rigollet was born in a rural French town with a population of only 365. His mother was a speech therapist, and his father taught grades two through five at the local elementary school. The 30-odd students in those four grades shared a single classroom, and during math class, Rigollet’s father would pose questions to each group in turn.\n" +
            "“That’s where I got used to being good at math,” Rigollet says. “I would try to listen to the harder questions from the upper class.”\n" +
            "The community was predominantly agrarian — “Raising chickens was a big thing,” Rigollet says — but his parents had a side line in door-to-door sales of health, beauty, and home-care products for Amway. Starting when Rigollet was 4, the family would attend Amway workshops in the U.S. for a week or two almost every year.\n" +
            "“That balanced out somehow the fact that I had a pretty limited perspective from where I grew up — the fact that I got to visit the United States,” Rigollet says.\n","On the strength of his placement exams, Rigollet earned a spot at a prestigious preparatory school in Lyon, which specialized in math and physics. He still had difficulty making himself learn stuff he didn’t want to learn, however: He excelled in math, but in physics, “I was just getting by,” he says.\n" +
            "“In physics, the rules were set a little too strongly for me,” he says. “Math allowed you more to have your own proof or your own way of thinking. It’s funny, because some people look for structure in math, and I’m looking for freedom. In what I’m doing now, I choose the model I want, and I do the math I want, and I do the description I want of these things.”\n" +
            "In the French educational system, every university has its own set of grueling entrance exams, which can last two or three days. Because Rigollet was a “bursar of the state” — he received financial aid through the French government — he could take as many exams as he chose, for free. He took seven, which was “kind of unheard of,” he says. All were for technical schools.\n" +
            "“I ended up being admitted to the three that did not have physics in their exams,” he says.\n" +
            "One of those was the small and somewhat obscure Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris (ISUP). “I didn’t know what statistics was,” Rigollet says, “but for some reason, I really enjoyed the exam.” So that’s where he enrolled the following fall.\n" +
            "At the time, ISUP was essentially a professional school, training students for careers as actuaries and financiers. Rigollet assumed that that’s the direction his career would take, too, until the summer after his second year, when he accepted an internship with a company that consulted for the insurance industry.\n" +
            "“I quickly realized the consulting company I was working for figured out what I could do, set the bar about halfway there, and then asked me to do it twice as fast,” he says.\n","The next year, just as the curriculum took a more practical turn, with upper-level courses such as “Mathematics for Insurance,” Rigollet enrolled in a class that, as he puts it, “changed everything.” That class, “Nonparametric Statistics,” exposed him for the first time to the rich mathematical principles that underlay the comparatively limited set of statistical tools that his other classes had been training him to use. On the heels of his dispiriting internship, the class changed the direction of his academic career.\n" +
            "At the end of the year — his last, in the French system — instead of buying a suit and embarking on an actuarial career, he headed to the University of Paris VI to pursue a PhD in statistics.\n" +
            "After graduating, Rigollet won a three-semester postdoctoral fellowship to Georgia Tech, and in the last semester he began applying for academic jobs. He wrote a program in the typesetting language LaTeX to generate application letters, automatically pulling in data such as the positions advertised and the names of potential colleagues, and applied for 140 jobs. To his amazement, he was called back for 60 interviews.\n" +
            "He didn’t follow up on all of them, but he did end up with a job offer from Princeton University’s new Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering, which he accepted. There he did what he describes as his best-known work, which imported concepts from theoretical computer science into statistics.\n" +
            "Many data sets of interest to researchers in a wide range of fields are “high dimensional,” meaning that each data point is characterized by hundreds, thousands, or even millions of different values. A million-pixel image, for instance, could be characterized as a single point in a million-dimensional space.\n" +
            "Researchers analyzing clusters of high-dimensional data commonly use a technique called principal component analysis — and, particularly, sparse principal component analysis — to reduce data complexity. Sparse principal component analysis is a way of representing clusters of thousand- or million-dimensional data using only a few dimensions. If those dimensions are properly chosen, they’ll capture much of the variance found in the original high-dimensional data set.\n","The trick is properly choosing the new dimensions. Some techniques for choosing them are provably optimal, but in practice, they’re much too time-consuming for many applications. More efficient techniques have also been developed, but they’re provably suboptimal.\n" +
            "Rigollet proved that for any but the smallest data sets, a set of sparse dimensions cannot be computed both efficiently and optimally: There is a tradeoff between the two notions. The proof required him to establish a theoretical cap on the accuracy of efficiently computable solutions. This set a new research agenda for the field, by giving statisticians a new standard to shoot for.\n" +
            "For a statistician with an interest in computer science, however, a department of operations research and financial engineering was never a perfect fit. So in 2015, Rigollet moved to MIT. There he has continued to pursue parallel research tracks in pure statistics and machine learning. Some of his earliest work at MIT concerned statistical methods that could be used to optimize both the design of clinical trials and the targeting of ads to web users. More recently, he’s been investigating statistical techniques for interpreting data produced by the imaging technique known as cryoelectron microscopy, whose inventors were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n" +
            "“I love so much being here now,” he says. “People at MIT are a bit different than elsewhere. They really are. They feel strongly about what they want to do, and there’s sort of this good peer pressure of doing interesting things. You don’t just want publications. You want work that you can actually talk to your colleagues about.”\n","On a recent Monday morning, Vivienne Sze, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, spoke with enthusiasm about network architecture design. Her students nodded slowly, as if on the verge of comprehension. When the material clicked, the nods grew in speed and confidence. “Everything crystal clear?” she asked with a brief pause and a return nod before diving back in.\n" +
            "This new course, 6.S082/6.888 (Hardware Architecture for Deep Learning), is modest in size — capped at 25 for now — compared to the bursting lecture halls characteristic of other MIT classes focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence. But this course is a little different. With a long list of prerequisites and a heavy base of assumed knowledge, students are jumping into deep water quickly. They blaze through algorithmic design in a few weeks, cover the terrain of computer hardware design in a similar period, then get down to the real work: how to think about making these two fields work together.\n" +
            "The goal of the class is to teach students the interplay between two traditionally separate disciplines, Sze says. “How can you write algorithms that map well onto hardware so they can run faster? And how can you design hardware to better support the algorithm?” she asks rhetorically. “It’s one thing to design algorithms, but to deploy them in the real world you have to consider speed and energy consumption.”\n" +
            "“We are beginning to see tremendous student interest in the hardware side of deep learning,” says Joel Emer, who co-teaches the course with Sze. A professor of the practice in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a senior distinguished research scientist at the chip manufacturer NVidia, Emer has partnered with Sze before. Together they wrote a journal article that provides a comprehensive tutorial and survey coverage of recent advances toward enabling efficient processing of deep neural networks. It is used as the main reference for the course.\n","Nothing supernatural to see here, just a desert southwest chance for Ray and Maggie (Robin Tunney) to “start over.” They need it, for reasons that become clear as the story unfolds.\n" +
            "Or unravels. Because the moment Maggie chirps, “This all feels really good to mem Ray. I think we’re going to be real comfortable here,” Ray starts to have his doubts.\n" +
            "The “regular” customers at the Motor Way Motel give him the willies. The service station across the street is run by the menacing desert cousins of those “Deliverance” Georgians. The old owner of the motel, who fled the moment Ray’s check cleared, cannot be reached.\n" +
            "And there’s this crawl space behind the rooms. At every stop along its path, a one-way mirror is attached to the room’s wall. The creep inside the crawlway can watch truckers and hookers and the local dominatrix ply her trade. They all have their favorite rooms.\n" +
            "Before you know it, Ray’s the creep in question, peeping in on all kinds of “Twin Peaks/Blue Velvet” perversions.\n" +
            "When the guest of one of the paying customers turns up dead on the evening news, Ray is alarmed. Because he knows she was there, and the only way he could know that is if he was checking out her naked activities in Room Six.\n" +
            "So telling the busybody cop (veteran character actor Marc Blucas) is out of the question. Howard the sheriff seems awfully sure that Ray is in touch with the former owner, and that he’s been told…something.\n" +
            "Confronting the dominatrix only gets him in trouble, and a warning.\n" +
            "“You know, the more you watch, the less you feel.”\n" +
            "A dead pig in the pool, a cop asking more questions, somebody knows something and Maggie is both in the dark and in danger, thanks to Ray’s predicament.\n" +
            "Tunney is stuck playing a wife rendered unstable by whatever brought them there and Ray’s role in that. And Cage does a tamped-down version of his Everyman-We-Watch-Come-Unglued, as Ray.\n","With the uproar caused by President Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the contested Jerusalem, thoughts of Mideast peace seem ever more remote. These recent events add poignancy to a look back at one period in modern history when the peace process seemed vaguely encouraging. The Oslo Diaries, a documentary premiering in Sundance, revisits that time in the 1990s, and the film is not unique in wistfully recalling that era. Last year’s Tony award-winning play, Oslo, dramatized those negotiations in a more theatrical format. The new film from Israeli directors Mor Loushy and Daniel Sivan will surely benefit from some of the same acclaim.\n" +
            "The directors, who also worked on another Sundance documentary, Censored Voices, a couple of years ago, have taken a non-traditional approach to the subject. Instead of relying merely on talking heads and newsreel footage from the era, they include a number of re-enactments of the meetings in Oslo, with actors impersonating the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. The filmmakers also include excerpts from books and diaries later written by the principal participants; these excerpts are also read by actors. \n" +
            "This technique is less controversial than it once was. Still, it can sometimes be disorienting to see these staged scenes juxtaposed with footage from the period and from present-day (or fairly recent) interviews with the surviving players. The disorientation is doubled because some of the actors who appear in the re-enactments look remarkably like the real negotiators interviewed two decades later. (Some of them, of course, have aged more gracefully than others.)\n","Creep follows freelance videographer Aaron (Patrick Brice) as he arrives at a remote mountain residence for his latest assignment, with the character's eventual dealings with Mark Duplass' oddball Josef progressing from benignly bizarre to frighteningly menacing. It's perhaps not surprising to learn that Brice and Duplass, credited with the movie's story, improvised much of their dialogue, as Creep possesses a palpably meandering feel that persists for the duration of its appropriately brisk running time - which, in turn, ensures that the film is often as entertaining as it is tiresome (ie there's an erraticness that's been hard-wired into the proceedings). And although the opening half hour occasionally seems just a little too laid-back in its execution, Creep, past a certain point, adopts an unexpectedly sinister vibe that's perpetuated by a series of suspenseful, downright creepy sequences (eg Josef blocks a door while wearing an animal mask, Josef stands at the top of a dimly-lit set of stairs, etc). It's clear, too, that the movie benefits from Duplass' seriously effective turn as the obviously-unhinged Josef, as the actor does a nice job of ensuring his character never quite becomes the generic bad guy one might've anticipated. The chilling final stretch ultimately confirms Creep's place as a better-than-average horror effort, with the movie's less-than-consistent execution generally outweighed by a persistently unpredictable atmosphere.","A decent followup, Creep 2 follows struggling filmmaker Sara (Desiree Akhavan) as she agrees to spend a day working as a videographer for Mark Duplass' sinister figure (calling himself Aaron this time around) - with the movie detailing the expected fraught back-and-forth dynamic that ensues between the two disparate characters. Filmmaker Patrick Brice, working from a script cowritten with Duplass, delivers a fairly interesting spin on the original film's low-key atmosphere, as Creep 2's similar narrative has been goosed with a number of admittedly unexpected elements - with the most obvious and effective example of this the decision to transform Akhavan's Sara into a far-from-passive foil for Duplass' murderous character. It's just as apparent, however, that the lackadaisical, meandering atmosphere of the first film is just as problematic here as it was there (if not more so), as large swaths of the picture feel as though they've been entirely improvised and the midsection does, as a result, suffer from a wheel-spinning vibe that wreaks havoc on the already-tenuous momentum. Duplass' engrossing work as the charismatic antagonist is matched by a solid turn from Akhavan, while the movie benefits substantially from the inclusion of several overtly spellbinding sequences (eg Aaron makes an unexpected confession during a game of Two Truths and a Lie) - with the proliferation of such positive elements ultimately compensating for Creep 2's less-than-fully-realized atmosphere (ie this generally feels more like a sketch of an idea than a fully-fleshed-out feature).");
