It's not solid 60 fps and that's inexcusable. The developer didn't have the patch Available on time, we as gamers should sue the publisher for releasing an unplayable mess. I got this at launch played twice and not since even though I have xbox one x it's too little too late.","Oh yeah the teacher is a total, incompetent piece of shit. Why couldn't the teacher just take the extra effort to write out his notes on the blackboard and ask Shouko to confirm when she was ready to move on?

That hesitation because afraid of expressing emotions as they can be used against you. However as long as you can find a person who can connect with you, because you are never not alone.","People, especially men, aren't told to avoid emotional reaction or expressing them, but rather to control those reactions to a suitable expression at a suitable time. There is a world of difference between those two, and only those confused about the difference really have the emotional issues that come from actually avoiding emotions and try to put those emotions away. It is a self-inflicted issue stemming from misinterpretation or self-delusion, not outside pressures.","I call this the painting problem. Painting the walls of a room seems easy to an amateur: You just buy a few gallons at Home Depot and slap it on. But a professional knows that prep, trim, and cleanup are 80% of the job and they take skill. Anybody can slap paint onto the middle of a wall. What's difficult and time-consuming are making the edges sharp and keeping paint off the damn carpet.","My experience is a careful amateur painter is 1000% better than an average professional.

One final tip buy some of the disposable plastic liners for the roller tray so you don’t have to spend time washing out the tray at the end of the day.","Not sure where you're from but in Germany there are industry standards professionals have to adhere to. Sure, there are sloppy professionals like in any other job too but if they adhere to the industry standards, the result will be pretty much what you expect and they're not allowed to take shortcuts that result in lower quality work.\n" +

It seems the expectations vary drastically between different countries (though I'm sure there are quality professionals in the UK too).","Yes I agree especially the cleaning part. The kitchen and the rooms close to the kitchen it is critical to clean and clean and clean. The prep should take longer than the painting.\n" +

Local leaders would monthly come in and sit at a huge round table (40-50 cities/counties/regional leaders) and vote on projects. 800 million dollar projects would sail through with almost no questions in the first five minutes, but then the leaders would spend the next two hours of the meeting debating about the $100,000 pilot project to help the homeless.","Aside from the \"sample size of one\"-issue: how much time did your parents take, and how much effort and preparation time, and how did that compare to the time and effort the professional needed?

I expect that to be true of any profession that doesn't have some kind of rigorously enforced standard.","I really think microservices are a process win not a technical win.

                    "temperature-controlled, pitch dark warehouses where it can be kept safely until it's put back on the market a decade later, I really wouldn't expect the value to be related to what the art looks like at all.","Art is also extensively used for purposes of, ahem, conveniently moving large sums of money around. It would be difficult to differentiate an unusual price due to money laundering motives from an unusual price due to manipulation.","My wife works in the high-end art and auction world.\n" +
                    "I always joke that artists are the most extreme capitalist you will ever find. This is a world where a dinner table can easily be sold for 1$mio because it's owned by some famous person. Pretty fascinating world.\n" +

Fuzz your eyes to abstract the details of the art pieces and only look at the social structure around it, and that's all the information you need to predict demand.","I found this contradictory. Galleries set prices, but \"desirable collectors are well educated consumers and won’t blatantly overpay.\"\n" +
                    "What are collectors educated in, exactly? Is it reading the collective market and understanding the pricing signals it generates? Is it marking new art to this market?\n" +
                    "If the latter, how does that work if the art has no intrinsic value?","I suppose this means formal or accidental training in art and shared taste with the art market community. I presume the minimal level of skill is identifying famous artists' work from similar pieces of not-so-famous artists, recognizing influences and obvious pastiches, and so on.\n" +
                    "I.e. someone who had credibility among the art crowd and whos purchase of a work will function " +

                    "But relaxing? That would .. require more explanation.","Art is not utilitarian. Art doesn't have the function of being hanged in a wall or maximise good feelings. That's just a low trick to make common people buy it.\n" +
                    "Art is (self) expression.","It feels weird to say there's no conflict in Eurogames.\n" +

I can't think of a better way to learn about how emotions can control you than surrounded by family in a safe environment where nothing truly important is on the line.

With most games, I can let my kids win by making stupid decisions. With Snakes there is no such option.

Well, there are friendlier games, but Catan is fairly middle of the road in how much you can screw someone over.\n" +

Good times.","I am probably the only one playing Britain in the history of the game who never made it off the damn island. The game is really hard."+"I know it's not the main thrust of the article but to note: monopoly is supposed to end with one winner by a landslide because it was created as a critique of capitalism without land value tax. The original game had two sets of rules, one that was sustainable and one based on the current insanity you can find outside your window.","I don't think that's the problem! It's (as noted in many online articles) the last 2/3 of every game is the richest person getting more and more so, until too long later they win. Kind of a drag for everyone else.","I like it.

I’d love to monitor pain in my joints on a daily basis and have a real data points to show.","This is easily blamed on the shutdown, but it isn't that simple: Falcon Heavy static fire has been postponed numerous times.

So if they were confident to continue with a static fire on Monday and there were no other issues known I'd say it's fair to blame it on the shutdown. Of course, more issues could arise during the test, but we won't know now.","Officially yes, but I can imagine there being some bureaucratic delay until it's in full effect/everybody got the news.

They ruined Mass Effect and Battlefield I'm willing to give Anthem a chance because its a brand new IP with a ton of potential. If it doesn't deliver I will turn my back without looking back I didn't bother buying Battlefront 2 and I'm not going to bother with the Next Battlefield.","As much as I feel bad for the innocent developers who's lively hoods are at stake, their fates were sealed once EA took control even if it wasn't their choice to make. We see this time and time again and sadly BioWare's time is running out fast. Best case scenario is that the former employees can form a new studio and start over anew without EA. Unfortunately even in that event, EA will likely still hold all their existing tech hostage as they do.","In 2008, California passed Prop 11, which put the power to redraw district lines in the hands of the independent Citizen Redistricting Commission. Previously, the state legislature drew the lines, allowing incumbents to remain in power 99% of the time. In 2010, we passed Prop 20 to allow the commission to redraw district lines for US House seats as well. This effectively eliminated most forms of gerrymandering in our state. Other states should follow suit. Be warned: when we voted on Prop 11, it barely passed. The road to end gerrymandering will be an uphill battle.","The US has the Fakest democracy in the world, while in dictatorships things are clear, Americans has the illusion of democracy... the only country where you can win more people votes and lose the election!! where two parties control everything and on 3rd party has any chance to break the system!! where Big corporates bribe the elected officials publicly in the name of donations and lobbing, and this Gerrymandering!!!","direct voting and electoral map determined by geographical limits, both of provinces and districts... in Costa Rica! yay!... the only thing we have to deal with are those fcking christians wanting more money, mafias looking to set up businesses, drug dealers looking for shelter and routes, and corrupt politicians going after lifetime benefits from the State... other than that, no such things as predetermined voters, just mentally manipulated voters as the rest of the world....\n","They failed to mention the PC performance issues with this game. Bungie's help forum is full of posts with gamers experiencing fps problems with even high end PCs that has 1080tis . Myself included started having fps problems with my i7 6700k and Gtx 1070 ftw card. The game went from reaching over 160 fps to now barely reaching 60 fps with vsync turned off and going as low as 30 fps. Finally, I know this is a game issue because all my other games still work flawlessly such as Fortnite, and Overwatch.","Just isn't enough content, every level while open still feels linear. I expected more Wow style, but no. If you look at star citizen in its alpha state, performance aside, the game has more for you to do right now, and ships your can fly on your own, a fps arena, a flying ship arena, it right now has 3 moons that you can explore completely. I still have been having fun in destiny but have only played like 6 hours and reached level 12, the cap is 25, the game is only 30 hours long, then your left grinding for legendry's, could've been way better.","Lol. When the D2 beta released, I said pvp was boring int he forums. I had so many hateful responses. Players went as far as to throw my D1 play time in my face to say my opinion didn't matter (never mind I made a second account just to re-play Destiny 1). But where are those people now? Where are those hater who left insults on my wordpress because I said it was a half-ass game? Jumping ship. And here I am laughing. Okay. Maybe I'm not laughing, but I am laughing at them.\n" +

Cyclone is amazing but his performance in this role is largely unknown (considering his limited showing in season 3), and yuji is completely unknown. this team, if they get cyclone playing to his capabilities and yuji playing up to their level, can be a top 2 or 3 team in NA alongside the reigning world champs. all of them are mechanically great, its just a question of synergy, and adaptation to role for cyclone and spl for yuji. im excited for this team.","The house thing strikes me as werid; as only in the last two generations did owning your home become common for most people.\n" +

Seriously though, there's been some pretty huge drama going on in Roblox right meow. Ok, seriously all jokes aside, Roblox has been banning YouTuber's accounts on Roblox because they were giving away free robux back to the community. Those accounts had millions of robux on them, the costs spent on the accounts of said youtubers total to an amount of over $600,000. Landon and Poke are the only ones banned so far, but Roblox isn't stopping and the entire Roblox community is more than just \"angry\" with Roblox.
