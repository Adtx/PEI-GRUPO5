What I hate the most is how I've heard some people call the developers lazy. Being apart of their Discord for months now and been playing the game for a year before console launch I have to say, these developers are NOT lazy. The work put into the game is amazing, from the world design, the crafts, levels, music, and patches come out regularly. 34BigThings does not deserve to be called lazy because Redout is a game that does many things right like no microtransactions and it has a delivering gameplay. I highly recommend it to anyone.","For sure this is giving them a lot of free PR.. Threateninglegal action is bullshit though, and it would take a lot for my to buy a game from such an asshat developer.. They could just have reached out to DF in a civil manner.

This is mostly a cause of teenagers being dumb, self absorbed egotistical hormon driven beings. These attributes creat both the bullies and the victims. Both of these come from emotional insecurity and social inexperience. I should know, I have been both, not that long ago.

As an example: when new hotels are built, they are commonly outfitted with a collection of original art consisting of pictures and sculptures. This is certainly done to a large degree due to the utility of the art, which serves to make the hotel more interesting and aesthetically pleasing.

Areas suffering from scarce water, food and energy resources can see the situation deteriorate with the extra demand caused by an influx of tourists. There will often be a physical impact as well, with increases in local pollution or the effect on the eco-system of large-scale construction. More significantly, the generation of income for the local economy is often lower than envisaged. The majority of income can often go to multi-nationals such as airline companies and hotel chains.","Recent years have seen a growth in what is termed 'eco-tourism'. The aim of eco-tourism is to unite conservation and communities through sustainable travel. So what are the key elements of eco-tourism? In addition to minimizing the impact of tourism on the environment, successful eco-tourism should also raise the awareness of cultural and environmental issues amongst the local host destination and the visiting tourist. Eco-tourism should be a positive experience for the local community as well as the tourist.

Time-poor consumers continue to want exotic, convenient, mealtime solutions whilst at the same time being cautious about over-spending on take-aways and trips to the restaurant.

Despite rising fuel costs, insurance premiums and frequent traffic jams, 9 out of 10 of us still enjoy driving. Whether it’s visiting friends and relations, taking the family for a day out or even commuting to work, the car remains first choice for many people. Experts argue that unlike public transport, the car leaves us in charge of our own destiny, giving us the freedom to travel when and where we want. The car also gives us the opportunity to express ourselves. The kind of vehicle we drive tells the world something about who we are or what we aspire to be. Cars are not simply a means of transport but also something we wear.","Research carried out by the Health and Safety Council estimates that stress and mental illness continues to be neglected by many businesses, both small and large. And the economic impact of this is huge, costing employers around £26bn a year. Stress at work can lead to a lack of concentration, fatigue and low motivation, all of which will cost the company in terms of low productivity, customer satisfaction and the very reputation of the company itself. Employers are being urged to become more \"emotionally intelligent\" and to improve the way they deal with stress and mental illness.","Many people find it difficult to talk about their feelings, particularly if we're feeling weak or vulnerable. However, when suffering from stress it’s vital you seek help. It's important to feel you can talk honestly with a close friend, a loved one, a work colleague or doctor about what’s going on. Stress is easily diagnosed and there is plenty you can do to successfully treat and manage stress. One of the most effective of these is to share your feelings with those you trust. Remember that accepting help and support is not a sign of weakness. Close relationships are vital to helping you get through this tough time.","Nowadays, in some cultures there may often be confusion between generations about what is acceptable behaviour in certain situations. Older people sometimes complain, for example, about the real or imagined rudeness of others, such as in the use of electronic devices in public places. However, the younger generation do not regard electronic communication as intrusive, but rather as fundamental to their way of life. Only increased mutual understanding is likely to resolve potential conflict or confusion in any society. In this case, as in all others, it pays to be aware of other people’s points of view.","Adults can influence younger people in a good way, but also in a bad way. There are various possibilities how this can happen.\n" +
            "On the one hand, setting a good example is a quite useful way, because younger people will be able to see the adult’s behaviours and ways of thinking. They will see and feel the adult’s values and lives and may decide to become like them someday or at least to try to behave and think like adults.\n" +
            "On the other hand, offering advices seems to be the better way for me, how adults can influence younger people. Because, setting a good example to follow can be useful, but it also is pretty exhausting for adults and they may have some pressure as well. In addition, it’s just an opportunity for younger people, because they’ll decide rather they want to become like these adults or not.\n" +
            "In my opinion, younger people should try to learn how life works on their own. This will lead to more failures, but in my opinion, failing is normal and necessary. Of course this way of influencing is more exhausting for younger people, but I guess they’ll figure out how to do things on their own.\n" +
            "Failures are crucial for learning and for success, therefore I think that adults just should offer advices and show them, that they believe in them. That’s going to encourage younger people and they will try to learn and believe in themselves. That’s why I think, that offering advices is the better way how adults can influence younger people.","It's amazing that they can get away with this. It's a bribe by any other name.

            "And when you see this, is it hard to believe there are 2 tiers of justice in the inner city?","Yes, I lived in NJ around 15 years ago, and PBA cards were well known (but not much talked about), and that's precisely the way they worked. Subtly flash the card to a cop, and they might ignore it, they might take the card and skip the speeding ticket, or they might just skip the speeding ticket.\n" +
            "Yes, corruption, but not exactly a get out of jail free card either. Or that's how it seemed to be, mostly, in NJ, over a decade ago.\n" +
            "It's very possible that things are worse today (such things tend to devolve over time), or worse in NYC, or worse than what I saw at the time.","My dad used to get out of speeding tickets by bribing officers all the time using the same principle - when he handed over his licence there would be a banknote folded inside it(licences were in forms of booklets back then). If the policeman was on it, they would just take the money and not say anything - if they weren't, my dad would just say he forgot he had some emergency money in there. Worked about 90% of the time? That's not in US though, central/eastern Europe in the 90s was a very corrupt place.","In New York these cards are basically sold by the PBA to anyone willing to shell out the proper \"donation\". Prominently displayed on the card is the year the \"donation\" is given to ensure that it becomes an annual ritual (if you want your card to be honored). They also give out stickers that are usually applied next to the registration/inspection stickers (even though it is illegal to apply other stickers there).","Why do you say this?\n" +
            "I ask because, I am from Montana and I often find outside knowledge of Montana consists of \"they have an unlimited speed on the highway/interstate\" (which hasn't been true for quite sometime) mindset applied to any information about Montana. It is usually viewed as a red state, but it's a different kind of red than what you find on the coasts. Our governor is blue and our state was essentially founded by socialists. Our state is usually pretty vocal on political matters and protecting the public (our most famous and easiest example of course being protection of public lands).","Montana has an interesting history. There were stories that said that Montana statehood was delayed by 25 years due to support of the south during the civil war.\n" +
            "Jeanette Rankin, the first female member of congress, was elected twice, in time to be the sole vote against entering WWI and WWII. She was a pacifist and a Progressive Republican.\n" +

            "(Full disclosure: 3rd generation Montana citizen, living the expatriate life in Bridgeport, IL).","For this requirement to have any meaning, Montana would need to be able to enforce it (ie choose another isp). But that would show that the isp landscape isn't owned by monopolies. This would actually seriously undermine many arguments as to why net neutrality needs laws to protect it over what the market can do.\n" +
            "I wonder is if we will start to find out that maybe the isp market isn't as closed as we thought - wireless tech, more entrants, new tech - and those saying we need NN laws because the market isn't healthy enough will pivot to a more normative claim regardless of completion.\n" +
            "I am somebody who could easily be brought on board with specifically crafted NN laws, but see much of the title ii at all costs advocacy a little of the mark.","I'd like to think someday AI will help us make those technical decisions, even though we won't fully understand them because the human brain simply can't process the multi-dimensional complexity that a computer theoretically handles no problem. That leaves a lot of room for fear-mongering, but one man's utopia is another man's dystopia, I suppose.\n" +
            "As long as humans benefit, I say it's a worthwhile goal to at least explore. If that leads to the extinction of the human race through genetic defect or similar existential tragedy stemming from this, then maybe we just weren't cut out for this gig and should go the way of the dodo. Maybe on another planet, a higher intelligence will figure out how to peacefully coexist with an intelligence of their own creation/modification. Maybe this is just all an inevitable aspect of the evolutionary algorithm at work; who are we to think we can avoid it?","First,gene-editing will become accepted as a norm to prevent/cure? diseases.\n" +
            "Then, the same technology will be used to create superior beings (hacking our own evolution).\n" +
            "It's only natural that something which promises to heal, also aids in enhancement (think Viagra).\n" +
            "I for one am excited about it's prospects in the future. For example - Can we live in a world free from cancer?","As a type-1 diabetic, your body no longer produces any insulin at all. This means even without eating any carbohydrates, your blood glucose rates will elevate every hour until you eventually succumb into a coma and shortly after, perish. I use about 34 units of insulin per day, excluding any carbohydrates -- this largely depends on body type as well, some people use much more.\n" +
            "A type-2 diabetic on the other hand, depending on how far their disease has progressed, could potentially ween themselves off insulin entirely if they were to completely abandon carbohydrates. These diets are extremely hard to maintain, especially indefinitely, however.","I've never done that, but it was clear from observation that it was true. Here's what amazes me, that people like Bezos exist. I mean, treating people that work at Amazon (especially the warehouses!) like the employees of I-N-O, Amazon could be an even more valuable company. Instead of being an employer of last resort (I would take any job before I worked there), they could be the \"it\" place to work. Instead, Bezos allows people to be treated like complete shit.","Unfortunately it's a different ballgame with warehouse work like at AMZ. There is no customer facing service aspect, and very little quality difference between employees. What quality concerns there are can probably be traced back to an individual employee very easily; returns due to poor packaging or wrong item can easily be pinned on the culprit.\n" +
            "It's unfortunate, but not all manual/hard jobs are valued equally and often because they are simply not of equal value. Item pickers are going to eventually go the way of cotton pickers in developed countries. One of my best friends works for a startup developing AI controlled robotic pickers. There is a ways to go and it'll start with human augmented AI's but eventually AI's will be picking, sorting, and packing everything.","In case anyone is wondering why that doesn't help the OP's issue... In order for the potatoes to be soft on the inside, you have to gelatinize the starch. That means bringing the temperature up to about 60C. However, this results in a gelatin-like block -- no matter how crunchy the outside is. If you want the inside to be fluffy you need to subsequently crystalize the gelatinized starch. You do that by cooling it down. If you've ever eaten cold potatoes or rice, you know how dry it seems -- that's the starch crystals. If you then heat it up again, these crystals re-gelatinize, providing a fluffy interior.\n" +
            "It's often good to go through the cycle more than once, which is why you see recipes for \"triple fried\" french fries. I tend to like to blanch in salted water, freeze, blanch in oil, freeze and then fry. This also dissolves some of the starch on the outside and provides more surface area for the oil to create crunchy bits. Yeah, it takes all day...\n" +
            "Never been to In-N-Out, so can't comment on what they do.","The problem is that if you're big enough business-wise you don't care that much about NN. It's like in Germany when Google has to pay for content in Google News and they just tell the publishers they will not include them if they don't give it to them for free despite these new rules (which are stupid). But if you're a small startup or company and you want to do this you have no chance doing this. Same goes for NN. If someone wants to block Google or Netflix now they can't really get that much from them because they need them to sell their own product or otherwise people will leave. If you're small no-one cares and your can't do anything about it. So it hurts innovation from new companies but doesn't hurt any big established players.\n" +
            "Besides that they also have enough revenue to invest in their own fiber infrastructure like Google does and really everyone wants to get good access to their content so they connect to them.","Sorry to hear that your father went through this.\n" +
            "You may care to consider that people get held up in cars, even in their own homes.\n" +
            "If you're really concerned about mugging in public areas, there are basic safety steps that everyone can (should) take. Stick to well lit areas; don't wear headphones; don't use your phone; avoid any situation that doesn't feel right. If possible plan your route. In other words, have your wits about you.\n" +
            "Also, re the non-poor encasing themselves in cars. Crime increases when people perceive an increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots. Does this mean the rich should use footpaths to reduce mugging? Probably not. But it might mean that public transport should get major investment so it's not seen as a shitty option only for the poor. If that's really how it's seen, everyone who has no option but to walk must feel constantly pissed off.","That's because prior to being too old to drive, they didn't give a fuck about the public transportation system. Actually, even after being too old to drive, they happily continue to vote against public transportation.\n" +
            "It's bizarre to suggest our transportation system is failing them. It's exactly the transportation system they voted for, the transportation system a good bunch of them built, designed, railroaded through poor communities, terraformed cities to support. It's been failing large swaths of people for many centuries, but that generation didn't bother. They built this shrine to the personal automobile.\n" +
            "It's not even a case of buyers remorse. For the longest time in their life, they happily took advantage of limitless cheap fossil fuels, plenty of unregulated cars and wide roads to drive them on, and the best part, they managed to put it all on the tab for the next generation. Its Caligula all over.","I had a car accident a few month ago. I was the victim as the other driver did not give priority to the right. After the police arrived, they came to this conclusion, too. Turned out, that the other driver was a diplomat, who drove a brand new rented BMW, and did not understand why I was the victim. The driver was also an unwanted person in the country due to corruption scandals, and he was heading to the airport to leave the country for good. The police did not charge him due to the diplomatic immunity and patiently endured his crazy ideas that I was causing the accident on purpose, I was diving too fast, I am too young to know how to drive, and I was on my phone while driving etc. Of course, none of these was real, and ironically I could prove it thanks to the cameras there. I think this behaviour is not supposed to belong to a diplomat who represents his country on foreign soil.","Perfectly stated. That's precisely what these cards are - a physical token of nepotism and what I refer to as the \"blue wall of bullshit\". I had a very close friend offer me one of those Gold cards for family members once (his Uncle gave him one and his family is small and thus had extras). I told him to keep it because even if I could use it to get out of a ticket, I'd rather take the fine and keep my morality in tact. Plus, given my belief on these cards, I doubt I could even muster the gall to present one. I mean, honestly, how arrogant does a human being have to be to present that card when stopped by an officer, expecting that the officer is going to basically be like \"Aw shucks, guess my hands are tied. Please try not to do that again.\".","I think what ticks me off the most is that people who review the game and look at the mechanics don’t delve deep into them at all... they only see what’s baby fed to them. When they mentioned “Pro players might not find the game deep” is utter bull. The auto combos are there for casuals. For people who’s into the fighting game industry, We’ve already found long combos and mechanics based off the betas alone. Watch people like flame or Maximilian show case the game.\n" +
            "After all, things like super dash are punishable on block or use a 2H would destroy them.\n" +
            "I suppose what I’m trying to get at is companies that review fighting games are always from a casual stand point. Don’t take everything they say as fact. If you’re actually interested in the game, research it yourself!","Government shutdowns are not normal. I say if they can't reach an agreement, THEY should lose their pay, benefits, and all privileges that come with the highest pay to lowest output job in the entire fucking world until they get their shit together. I bet you wouldn't see any fucking shutdown then. Also, before any bill is signed or passed into law EVERY single prick who has a say in it should be given an in depth quiz on it's contents. 10 year olds are expected to recount the events of a Harry Potter book, extremely high paid do nothing with absurd amount of power should be held to at LEAST the same standard.","\"Social media\" isn't really a good rebuttal to people thinking things were rushed\n" +
            "The parts that were rushed the most are the parts that have nothing to do with social media\n" +
            "Added character development that wasn't in the manga gets too little time to build up, while character development that was actually in the manga isn't here at all, the final episode just casually skips what has to be months or even years of time in a single scene transition with the events that occurred in between only hinted at through context, the final battle was building up that whole fanservice GATTAI aspect which also played into the passing the baton theme that was being pushed, but didn't have much impact due to having only ten seconds of screentime, etc.\n" +
            "Also, north korea reached out to begin peace talks with south korea literally hours after trump made that tweet, so if you're scared of that ending the world you're not paying attention\uFEFF.","I kinda agree with the Aku no Hana, I love both version and the manga is one of my absolutely favorites, but I think couple of the first volumes were much weaker in manga while the anime really got me in to Kasuga's shoes, I didn't care about the 10 minutes of walking to home/back to school on episode 8 because I was so invested in Kasugas feelings and I literally had butterflies in my stomach entire time. \n" +
            "In later volumes I think the art got much more solid and the read was excellent, I especially loved how Shuzo Oshimi used sudden spread images and blank backgrounds, you read Aku no Hana so fast and when there's big spread page the impact is just something else.\n" +
            "If the anime had covered whole series I don't know which one I would have preferred overall, but on the parts anime did cover I prefer anime.\uFEFF","I was going to ask about antiperspirants without Aluminum because mine is without, and it doesn't leave yellow stains.\n" +
            "However, even though I put it on the night before so it's completely dry (and it lasts pretty much all day anyways), it still sometimes leaves white stains. Also, I just sweat so much that it doesn't really stop it completely (no matter when I apply it).\n" +
            "I actually think those stains are literally the antiperspirant being washed into the shirt by my sweat and drying again. There's no helping me, is there?\uFEFF","Egan’s Proustian meditation on time, fame and music won the National Book Critics Circle and Pulitzer awards. Who’s the goon of the title? “Time is the stealth goon, the one you ignore because you are so busy worrying about the goons right in front of you,” she says. Egan concocts her narrative around punk rocker-turned-music producer Bennie Salazar, his sticky-fingered assistant Sasha and a circle of wannabes, has-beens and hangers-on. Colette Bancroft, book editor of The Tampa Bay Times, named Egan’s novel her top pick “not just because it is a splendidly written experiment in form that succeeds resoundingly, but because the 21st Century is its essential subject matter. Egan juxtaposes timeless literary themes, most notably the inexorable journey from youth to age, with an exploration of the ways in which a rapidly changing world reshapes the human experience. It's a novel that is prescient, surprising, wise and simply a blast to read.”\n","House opens his espionage saga, a quartet of tightly linked novels, with a mysterious command: “Listen. There’s a problem and it can’t be solved. You need to disappear.” The order comes from a top executive for a US military contractor that runs ‘burn pits’ in Iraq to incinerate excess weapons of war. The man known as Sutler, a newly hired mid-level operative, is soon on the run, blamed for embezzling a vast sum. He leaves behind a team of civilian workers, lured with the promise of decent jobs and benefits, who are all sickened by the toxic smoke that surrounds them every day and who, plan to exact revenge. Meanwhile Sutler’s exit path, plays out across Iraq, Istanbul, Italy and Cyprus. House draws inspiration from Roberto Bolanoand and Émile Zola, but this chilling post-9/11 masterpiece is all his own.","Good documentarians get to know their subjects, of course, but it’s easy to imagine Ross on the other side of the lens, a subject in another inquisitive, empathetic mind’s documentary about the ebb and flow of life in Hale County, Alabama. He understands the area and its inhabitants because he’s one of them, which is to say he understands his subjects in ways most documentary filmmakers will envy. “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” pulses with that hyper-specific familiarity, capturing in just an hour and sixteen minutes the passage of years through both long static takes and fleeting, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moments of profound mundanity. Sweat drips from a young man identifiable only by his feet, dribbling to the concrete in lockstep with the basketball in his hands; Ross then cuts to stone pavers as they’re splashed by a rainstorm.","");
