Being apart of their Discord for months now and been playing the game for a year before console launch I have to say, these developers are NOT lazy. The work put into the game is amazing, from the world design, the crafts, levels, music, and patches come out regularly. 34BigThings does not deserve to be called lazy because Redout is a game that does many things right like no microtransactions and it has a delivering gameplay.

This is mostly a cause of teenagers being dumb, self absorbed egotistical hormon driven beings. These attributes creat both the bullies and the victims. Both of these come from emotional insecurity and social inexperience. I should know, I have been both, not that long ago.

For example, local shops can be demolished to make way for larger retail developments. In addition, the negative effects on the environment are well documented. Areas suffering from scarce water, food and energy resources can see the situation deteriorate with the extra demand caused by an influx of tourists. There will often be a physical impact as well, with increases in local pollution or the effect on the eco-system of large-scale construction. More significantly, the generation of income for the local economy is often lower than envisaged. The majority of income can often go to multi-nationals such as airline companies and hotel chains.","Recent years have seen a growth in what is termed 'eco-tourism'. The aim of eco-tourism is to unite conservation and communities through sustainable travel. So what are the key elements of eco-tourism? In addition to minimizing the impact of tourism on the environment, successful eco-tourism should also raise the awareness of cultural and environmental issues amongst the local host destination and the visiting tourist. Eco-tourism should be a positive experience for the local community as well as the tourist. Finally, eco-tourism should offer clear financial benefits to local people and to local conservation issues.","It also owned their holiday home in Florida, funded the upkeep of another holiday home in the south of France, paid for trips to New York and Miami, and spent more than £100,000 a year funding Mr Faulkner's hobby of classic yacht racing.\n" +

Time-poor consumers continue to want exotic, convenient, mealtime solutions whilst at the same time being cautious about over-spending on take-aways and trips to the restaurant.

Despite rising fuel costs, insurance premiums and frequent traffic jams, 9 out of 10 of us still enjoy driving. Whether it’s visiting friends and relations, taking the family for a day out or even commuting to work, the car remains first choice for many people. Experts argue that unlike public transport, the car leaves us in charge of our own destiny, giving us the freedom to travel when and where we want. The car also gives us the opportunity to express ourselves. The kind of vehicle we drive tells the world something about who we are or what we aspire to be. Cars are not simply a means of transport but also something we wear.","Research carried out by the Health and Safety Council estimates that stress and mental illness continues to be neglected by many businesses, both small and large. And the economic impact of this is huge, costing employers around £26bn a year. Stress at work can lead to a lack of concentration, fatigue and low motivation, all of which will cost the company in terms of low productivity, customer satisfaction and the very reputation of the company itself. Employers are being urged to become more \"emotionally intelligent\" and to improve the way they deal with stress and mental illness.","Many people find it difficult to talk about their feelings, particularly if we're feeling weak or vulnerable. However, when suffering from stress it’s vital you seek help. It's important to feel you can talk honestly with a close friend, a loved one, a work colleague or doctor about what’s going on. Stress is easily diagnosed and there is plenty you can do to successfully treat and manage stress. One of the most effective of these is to share your feelings with those you trust. Remember that accepting help and support is not a sign of weakness. Close relationships are vital to helping you get through this tough time.","Nowadays, in some cultures there may often be confusion between generations about what is acceptable behaviour in certain situations. Older people sometimes complain, for example, about the real or imagined rudeness of others, such as in the use of electronic devices in public places. However, the younger generation do not regard electronic communication as intrusive, but rather as fundamental to their way of life. Only increased mutual understanding is likely to resolve potential conflict or confusion in any society. In this case, as in all others, it pays to be aware of other people’s points of view.","Adults can influence younger people in a good way, but also in a bad way. There are various possibilities how this can happen.\n" +
            "On the one hand, setting a good example is a quite useful way, because younger people will be able to see the adult’s behaviours and ways of thinking. They will see and feel the adult’s values and lives and may decide to become like them someday or at least to try to behave and think like adults.\n" +
            "On the other hand, offering advices seems to be the better way for me, how adults can influence younger people. Because, setting a good example to follow can be useful, but it also is pretty exhausting for adults and they may have some pressure as well. In addition, it’s just an opportunity for younger people, because they’ll decide rather they want to become like these adults or not.\n" +
            "In my opinion, younger people should try to learn how life works on their own. This will lead to more failures, but in my opinion, failing is normal and necessary. Of course this way of influencing is more exhausting for younger people, but I guess they’ll figure out how to do things on their own.\n" +
            "Failures are crucial for learning and for success, therefore I think that adults just should offer advices and show them, that they believe in them. That’s going to encourage younger people and they will try to learn and believe in themselves. That’s why I think, that offering advices is the better way how adults can influence younger people.","It's amazing that they can get away with this. It's a bribe by any other name.

In order for the potatoes to be soft on the inside, you have to gelatinize the starch. That means bringing the temperature up to about 60C. However, this results in a gelatin-like block -- no matter how crunchy the outside is. If you want the inside to be fluffy you need to subsequently crystalize the gelatinized starch.

            "available.","Its probably as much to do with the British class system and the fact that the civil service was run by amateur chaps who knew chaps in the same club who had done classics at Oxbridge.\n" +
            "And now that the war was over all those gurls and those greasy engineers should go back to where they had come from.\n" +
            "Its also similar to the way in the last few months of the war career officers (proper chaps again) who " +
            "had had a desk job where parachuted in to command positions to benefit thee post-war career.","I remember reading \"The Innovators\" by Walter Isaacson, and the story of Sir TimBL and how he invented the WWW. At one point, TimBL says that Data Structures aren't efficient, and today's kids just superficially know the upper layers of the software stack, and don't know what really goes on at the transistor level. He also says that the limits of computing are only limited by your imagination.\n" +
            "Now I realize it actually runs in the family.","I don't pretend to completely understand it either, but one crucial point here is that these complex amplitudes and their interactions are the \"real\" reality - they are \"more real\" than the normal probabilities we are used to, in that they are the things that actually exist in the universe and give rise to the 'normal' probabilities that we see.\n" +
            "A lot of mental resistance to quantum mechanical ideas comes from thinking quantum mechanics is weird, " +
            "instead of thinking quantum mechanics as normal and us being weird[1], because of the scale we live in and normally observe things in.","To chime in on the probabilities issue: they aren’t really probabilities.\n" +
            "Probability amplitudes are something we don’t really understand, but it is true that once we have set a basis for measurement, we can treat the amplitudes with respect to that basis as probabilities (written in complex form).\n" +
            "However, this should not be interpreted as “quantum states are probabilistic mixtures of base states” - changing the measurement basis screws up that intuition. For example, if our new basis has one base vector that is equal to the quantum state we are measuring, suddenly our outcome is certain.\n" +
            "Oh I wish I could explain this better.","Ah, no worries. Post-quantum cryptography has a reputation for being somewhat excessively theoretical (which to be fair is a reasonable argument). But there are benefits other than post-quantum security. For example, lattice problems can provide security according to worst-case hardness, whereas factoring problems can only provide average-case hardness.\n" +
            "In other words, for some lattice problems, we can prove that breaking the cryptosystem is equivalent to breaking every instance of the lattice problem, but factoring problems only guarantee that breaking the cryptosystem is equivalent to breaking a subset of problems from some distibution. The former is a much stronger security assumption (though in practice this comes with its own set of challenges).\n" +
            "It’s an exciting area of research.","There is a Public crypto system based off error correcting codes that is quantumly secure. It's the McEliece cryptosystem, it's about as old as RSA. However, the key sizes are in 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands of bits.\n" +
            "From my reading most crytographers think it's is secure. So if you need it now. You could probably get away with using it. However, one should have a decent explanation to why use a less well known algorithm. It's probably had less eyes looking at so a major flaw/attack could exists, but it's not if one does exist.");
