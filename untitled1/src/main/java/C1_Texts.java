            "Well, I lived that lifestyle in high school. I studied 4 hours a day, limited every extracurricular activities to not interfer with my study time. At the end I believe I have missed a great portion of my life and it was not worth it.\n" +
            "Studying everyday is a great goal to aspire for, but no way you need to study that much every day. Go to classes with the textbook, mark the areas the teacher lectures about. Take notes during class. Once in a while review the book and your notes. In the meantime make thought experiments, try to apply the information you learned on imagined cases you made up for fun.\n" +
            "There is only so much willpower you can tap into. Once that is over you basically drift not being able to do anything. It is much better to live a balanced life and never put yourself into impossible workloads for a prolonged time.\n" +
            "Another point is that these kind of study hacks work for people who can already study. If you are a procrastinator in soul (a deep procrastinator in Newport's terms), this advice won't help you. If you're procrastinating heavily your mind is trying to tell you that what you're doing is pointless.\n" +
            "One powerful weapon to fight it is to keep an agenda. Plan your day before (for example using org mode or a simple paper agenda). Set very small goals and always reschedule if you need to. For example 22 Jan Monday: place the notes taken during X class in a file. 23 Jan Monday: Buy the book required for Y class etc.\n" +

            "studying or mentally overwhelmed, it helps a lot to put on headphones and blast some talkshow in the background. The change in the tone and volume of the host and occasional jokes and laughter feed my stimuli seeking brain. After 30-40 minutes I can continue without listening anything.","I've been pondering what the point [nowadays] is of all these board games I played as a child. Risk, Axis & Allies, Colditz, Monopoly, Stratego (I played all these games below the recommended game). As well as PnP RPGs, card games, and collectible card games. My problem is that, at an older age, I don't regularly meet friends anymore in physical space \"just because\", and on a birthday this doesn't fly either. Things like Friday evening RPG night? No way. Heck, I don't even have the friends anymore who are into that. That's what makes an electronic game much more accessible be it single player or MMO.\n" +
            "The answer is that as a teenager, we didn't have mobile phones etc (or well, barely) and we resorted to physical games such as card games. And as a kid, it was part of being friends with schoolmates, or (as you put it) playing with my parents. So we were already enforced, pretty much, being in physical space, overcome out boredom, and bended that to pleasure in such a way that we enjoyed being with each other.\n" +
            "The point being, that these games are still solid for youth and parents playing with youth. Heck, its partly even my problem that I don't initialise card games on a birthday.\n" +
            "Being autistic and opposite sex of my kid poses challenges though. Its still a long way down the road " +
            "but while teaching them to become competitive in games and learning to win and lose seems invaluable, with a girl I'm inclined to not bother with violence or war-theme (or WWII) games. There's tons of these available, but it does pose limitations.","I wasted tons of time while I was in high school, so kudos to you for aspiring for more and trying to be productive. Respect.\n" +
            "On the other hand, don't forget to have fun! You have your whole life to be \"grown up\", but only a few years to be young and reckless, don't squander em. I feel old for writing that, but whatever.\n" +
            "Don't overwork yourself, and don't let others take advantage of your enthusiasm. Burnout is real, so make sure none of your habits put you on the path towards self-destruction. Avoid the temptation of staying up 1 or n-more hours just to finish some thing; it'll always be there for you the next day, so it's usually better for you to get a full night of rest instead.\n" +
            "In my experience, some aspects of school are overrated. It's easy to get fixated on grades, but they're " +
            "not always representative of someone's true skills. Of course, you shouldn't lie to yourself either, so strive to actually understand whatever subject you're focused on.","Here's some of my personal experience how I have learned to study better in university:\n" +
            "While reading through your material, take notes. Moreover take notes that make sense to you. Don't copy something for the sake of it if you don't understand it, try write it down in a way that reflects your current knowledge of it and how it makes sense to you.\n" +
            "Also I wouldn't probably take everything in that article word for word. I mean:\n" +
            "Do not listen to music or TV: It is virtually impossible to do two things at once if one of them is studying.\n" +
            "sound just silly, okey I listen to calmer music when I study but should you always advocate for total ruthless silence? I think there's other aspect overlooked by the writer(s) that you should try to make studying enjoyable or at least tolerable.\n" +
            "Of course in a way it is similar to straining yourself in physical exercise and more you do it the better you get at it but at times studying hard leaves you only depleted and uninspired about the work you do. I used to do studying in a group which while entertaining didn't really at times help me to internalize the material. Now when I do mostly self-studying I can internalize really well but the solitude is kinda boring at times. Until you get into the flow and really start digging what you are doing at least.\n" +
            "But my advice to anyone who wants to study better is to take it seriously. Take notes from your material. Write down mind-maps or whatever from the concepts to help you visualize them. Use Youtube to find lessons if you feel the material is too abstract. Ask questions from people smarter than you (if there is anyone around). Implement your own solutions about problems you care about (if applicable). The mental border I see when people study is that some just want to pass the course and get perhaps a good grade. How I have started to study is I want internalize the key-concepts so well that I can use them. That means that I might spend ridiculous amounts of hours on some basic concept until it makes sense to me. At times that might cause me to miss on couple other concepts but that's the trade-off I'm willing to make.\n" +
            "After you have studied the subject comes the hard part that is actually maintaining that knowledge. This" +
            " is where I think having learnt key-concepts well really helps as you have those couple key-points to which you can return to quite easily. On the other hand if I didn't try to apply the concepts to something concrete I'll probably forget how those abstract ideas were ever linked to \"reality\".","In my essay I’d like to write about my opinion and change after my ERASMUS life in Norway. To my mind usually people dream about abroad but they are afraid to do something to take a step to move and they just act tourist but never try to work. Hungarians are skeptical against “dreams”.\n" +
            " I was lucky and chosen (the only one student from Hungary) who got a place in a small town in Norway, Halden to study. Norway is a colorful country with many migrants. Nowadays I heard from Norwegians that they personally do not really accept immigrants anymore, because they are “stealing” the jobs away. To my mind students are rather those people, who are enough brave to risk a travel and living – to try to start a new life abroad.\n" +
            "There is not just only one opportunity to move abroad. Also a work-exchange is possible. It’s chooseable: either 1 or 3 years you can choose. In Halden I became real good friends with some Italian, Swiss, American and Japanese doctors at an international “Reactor Project”. Usually exchange-workers are around the age of 30. \n" +
            "Actually foreigners have stereotypes about incoming workers. However Norwegians are quite intelligent – everyone speaks English like a native – they do not really know about Hungary. But at least we are not muslims and do come from Europe – we are accepted there. \n" +
            "I think if someone did at least a year abroad, it also might high up the level of his/her intelligence – that’s why they have more chances to get or to keep a job. \n" +
            "Language is a quite important part of the globalization. If someone can talk in a main language (English, German, Spanish, etc.) and in addition some in small ones (Hungarian, Finnish, tc.) he or she has much more chances at every field of (global) work. \n" +
            "Hungary always had the chance for exchange as a student: earlier in the Sowyet Union, now almost on the whole Earth. With the European Union and the Shengen we also have the opportunity for an exchange work of internship. \n" +
            "I feel lucky with my start of life: my mother tounge is German, I learned Hungarian in the kindergarten and I became addicted to languages, started to learn Finnish and English, I moved to Norway and I learned Norwegian there. Now I speak 4 languages fluently and one (Finnish) just on the basic level. If someone makes a time abroad, he/she is going to be open for other languages and cultures. This point we’ve got to highlight well, because multiculturism just started recently – and it ain’t stop. \n","In my journal today I’m going to write about my opinion about a topic (after a webpage) about potential virtual schools in the following century. \n" +
            "As I was learning at the elementary school, teachers always forced us to work in teams. I never liked it – it did disturb me all the time that I’m the only one in the group who takes the given work serious. I liked reading lessons and homeworks – also I liked the test – because they’ve been rather individual and independent. Later I recognized that it also can make fun and right now. I believe that cooperation is always needed. I do not really think that it’s possible to study by our own. Psychologically people need friends. Also it might be a kind of aim to be under people, to learn cooperating with people for kindergartens and schools when we get out into the life of workers we could give the expected niveau of work. \n" +
            "To my mind only literature is that subject that can be tough electronically With a webcam and a software like Skype is enough. But in maths, biology and any other classes children need the teacher to be attend. They need someone who walks along the tables and checks and corrects their daily work. If it happens as the author on that homepage explained, the student-student (I might risk to say also friendship) relationship and the student-teacher relationship will be slowly disappearing. In this case people ain’t feel love for others, it’s going to be harder to get a partner. I also can imagine that people are going to look for their matches on webpages, they’ll get engaged, married – but they’re never really going to love each but just their kid.\n" +
            "And a child, with no family that can show the needed amount of love, can also become dangerous to other people. \n" +
            "The electronic learning already started – as I recognized it in Norway as I’ve been studying there. In my class we’ve been 7, but I’ve been attend always alone, because my classmate were doing electronical job. I also got many tasks that I should record my essay and handle it in the format of “mp3” in. To my mind it’s a good way at languages to correct the accent.\n" +
            "I have plenty of plans with my children and their children and it doesn’t really contain internet. But like the article they’re gonna get in the middle and learn on a well required niveau. \n" +
            "It’s not a piece of cake to learn by our own. There is not going to be any motivation (heard from a classmate for example) and it parents don’t care, their child is going to fail at school and later at life. \n" +
            "But the most important thing at studying-home is the lack of the realizing about the beautyness of the world. No matter what people do in their free time but it they don’t have friends, they do not really organize trips in the nature – they’ll forget about it and slowly the interest for each and the Blue Planet will disappear.\n","One of the main objectives of education is to prepare children for work . In order to help a country grow economically , schools are encouraging students to study science , economics , computer skills , business and maths . Creative subjects like art and music are considered less important . However , I believe that they should continue to be taught in schools.\n" +
            "Music courses often include several different strands . At my school , the music course includes performance , music theory and composition . Each of these areas teaches a child different skills . Performing teaches children confidence . Music theory teaches analytical and mathematical skills . Composition allows students to be creative . Although it is true that many students who are interested in music take classes outside school , many young people do not have this opportunity because their parents aren’t musical . That’s why we need to continue to provide music lessons at schools.\n" +
            "Another creative subject under scrutiny is art . But art is everywhere in our society . It is in the clothes we wear and in the design of the products we buy . School art students go on to become illustrators, designers and architects . Also , creative people are often successful in other fields such as teaching and business . We need to encourage young people to think creatively and school art lessons are important in this way.\n" +
            "To conclude , I think it is very important that schools continue to teach creative subjects such as art and music as well as those subjects that are considered more important for the country’s economy . Not all young people get the opportunity to explore their creative sides out of school , and confident , creative people are equally important to a country’s economy as economists and scientists .\n","Hi Louisa , \n" +
            "Thanks for your email . I’m glad you can join us for the weekend away . There are indeed still free places , so your sister can come if she wants . I think the theme park has some rides for children , but my friends and I are definitely going to spend the day on the big rides , so your sister might have to spend time alone with Maddy , and so she might feel a bit left out . There is a twin room free that your sister and Maddy can have . Your sister will have to be careful with Maddy because there’s a lake on the site and we wouldn’t want Maddy to fall in .  It gets quite muddy there and it will be getting dark when we arrive , so your sister had better not let Maddy run off . As you know , I’ve booked a night out at a curry restaurant and a bar in the evening , and I don’t think that’ll be suitable for Maddy . She’ll probably need to be tucked up in bed by that time . Your sister will have to stay at the cottage alone to look after her , unless you’re happy to stay in and keep her company . So , in short , your sister is welcome to come , but it might be a bit boring for her at times . \n","While you are in Westbury , you must visit the White Horse Country Park . The park is situated on the top of a hill overlooking the town , and has magnificent views across the countryside . The famous white horse , a chalk symbol which can be seen from many miles away , lies on the side of the hillside . The park is also the site of an Iron Age fort , and everyone , from young children to adults , can enjoy climbing on the banks and can even roll down some of the gentle slopes . If you have a kite , bring it along because there is often a strong breeze on the hill . There are a number of paths around the park where you can take in the view . These may not be suitable for people with pushchairs , wheel chair users and people who are unsure of their footing . After your exertions , you can enjoy an ice cream from the ice cream van which is always present . The easiest way to get there is by car . Just leave the town along the Bratton road and take the road on the right next to the pottery shop . The road is well signposted . If you don’t have a car , you can get a taxi . A trip will cost about £5 from the town centre . Otherwise it’s a steep , 45-minute walk . Entrance to the park is free of charge .","Dear Sir / Madam , \n" +
            "I read your advertisement in Students International and I would be very interested in volunteering in the sporting event you are organising . I am a French student and I have been studying English for eight years . I have taken part in several language exchange visits to the United Kingdom , so I can communicate confidently and quite fluently in English in social situations . I also speak a little Italian and German . \n" +
            "I believe that I have good personal qualities which make me an effective volunteer for your event . I am outgoing and enjoy meeting people from different cultures . I have played in the college volleyball and football teams for over four years , so I am used to working with other people and encouraging them in our shared endeavours . I also have work experience in working on the front line with customers . I work at weekends in our local supermarket , which requires me to deal with customers with a pleasant attitude and liaise with other staff . I have also worked as a receptionist in a hotel in the south of France as a summer job . Here , I had to welcome guests and deal with any problems which arose . I can send you references from these employers if you need them.\n" +
            "Thank you for your interest in my application . I look forward to hearing from you .\n","Thank you for giving me the opportunity to give feedback about my experiences at Brightwell College. Firstly , I’d like to talk about the teachers , who were excellent . They prepared us very well for examinations , and it’s down to them that so many of us obtained good grades. We always had the opportunity to discuss our ideas in class and the teachers never dismissed our ideas , no matter how strange they were ! Having said that , the homework workload was very high. The teachers were very strict about handing it in and rarely gave us extensions . Although I realise that homework is important, I do feel they could have been given less homework and been less strict about deadlines , as this often prevented us from getting involved in sports and clubs and having evening jobs. Furthermore , although the teaching was excellent , the facilities were not. The text books we used were very outdated , the library did not have enough desks , and there were not enough copies of important books . There were also not enough computers for the whole class to use at the same time . Socially , there were a lot of sports and music clubs to join , but very few others . I would have been interested in taking extracurricular classes in drama , woodwork and cookery but these classes were not available , which was disappointing . Secondly , the school organised very few outings except for a few geography and biology field trips , and I would have liked the opportunity to go on activity holidays with my classmates , such as ski trips or adventure sport weekends","I would like to respond to your request for money-saving tips for students . As I see it , there are two main things that a student needs to think about : how increase your income , and how to reduce your outgoings . \n" +
            "Getting a part time job is really worthwhile when you’re young . Not only does it bring money in , but it will impress future employers . Find a job which fits into your schedule . Many shops offer Saturday jobs , while you can get jobs at bars and restaurants in the evening . There are also lots of holiday jobs available in hotels , holiday camps or on farms . \n" +
            "Secondly , you need to decrease what you spent . If you cook for yourself , buy value products and avoid ready-made meals . Share cheap recipes with friends . You will save money on food and energy bills if you buy food and cook it in bulk , so get together with friends and share the cooking . When shopping for clothes and utensils , buy second hand from markets or from online auction sites . Just don’t get carried away ! It’s easy to spend a lot when things are cheap ! \n" +
            "Of course , you don’t want to stop spending altogether , or you will never have any fun ! So it’s important to prioritise . Decide what’s important to you , whether it’s sports , travel , good food , nights out or nice clothes , and put enough money aside for that . Then you can scrimp and save on the things that you consider less important .\n","Dear Sir/Madam, \n" +
            "I attended a twenty-four hour per week course for two weeks in July at the Heaton School of English. I am writing to you because I understand that this school is accredited by your organisation. \n" +
            "The standards of the school fell short of those expected from an accredited school and those which were advertised by the school. \n" +
            "The school promised qualified and experienced native English teachers. In reality several of these teachers had not taught before and lacked any knowledge of pedagogy. The classes were made up of a random selection of students: different ages, abilities and reasons for studying English. \n" +
            "I was promised in advance a course to prepare me for examinations but this was unavailable, so how the school can boast of a high exam pass rate is inexplicable. The school also undertook to provide modern functioning computers; in reality the computers were both dated and often non-operational.\n" +

            "Last week in a rainy November morning I set off from my home to drive into town, along about a quarter of the ring road in the direction of the town hall. In all, the journey is about ten kilometres; it took an hour and a half. \n" +
            "From Monday however to make the same journey I will have to buy a EUR 10 sticker for my windscreen window. Entering the ring round and the centre of the town without a sticker will cost EUR 100 in an on-the-spot fine. \n" +
            "Congestion charging has been proposed for years, but when Arnie Fischer was re-elected mayor for a third term in April, he gave an explicit promise to promote the charge. As he pointed out yesterday in the Grenberg Times the charge ‘will lessen congestion and raise money for public transport.’ Fischer has allocated an extra EUR 1 million to upgrade the bus and tram network. \n" +
            "The campaign Grenberg Free Roads has mounted an on-going battle against road charging. Group spokesperson, Edgar Grice, told me yesterday, ‘We are going to challenge this law in the courts. Nobody is going to make me pay for using the public roads.’ Perhaps Mr Grice will be among the first people to pay the EUR 100 fine. \n" +

            "For those who enjoy romantic comedy, you shouldn’t miss Ben Gold’s “It Happened to Me” featuring young Sarah Jenner as the incurable romantic Jude Smith. Producer, Hermann Shils has made several innovations on the original play, nearly all of which have added to the humour and flow of the performance. Also don’t miss an excellent performance by the slick and well-casted Jeremy Fletcher as the hapless Alfie. \n" +
            "Tuesday and Friday are given over to heavy-going “Death in the Morning” by local playwright, Miriam Pink. The protagonist, Elsa, is played by the talented Gertrude Horn who has made this tragic role her own. Some commentators doubted whether Pink could produce this performance of her own play, but she seems to have effortlessly made the transition from playwright to producer. \n" +
            "Seats are selling fast for “It Happened to Me” which has the edge on popularity, though, while singing the praise of both plays, I would say “Death in the Morning” is the better drama. But why not treat yourself to two theatre outings this week?\n","‘Stereotypes help us understand the world.’ \n" +
            "Stereotypes, as forms of generalisation and the abstraction of the key features of things, are necessary for understanding the world around us; however the blind use of stereotypes can lead to misunderstanding. \n" +
            "If, for example, you imagine every type of chair in the world you have an array of thousands. Yet to all these entities we apply the stereotype – or label – chair. If somebody asks us what a chair is we don’t start by listing everything that is a chair. Instead, we utter some key features of a chair which in our view characterise all chairs; e.g. a surface for sitting above the ground. \n" +
            "What applies to chairs of course applies to everything else in the world that we think about: a family, a government, bad behaviour and so on. What then are the dangers in this mode of abstraction? I will mention two. \n" +
            "First, and perhaps most important, is when we assemble stereotypes according to prejudicial thinking. In the past, and among some people today, concepts are constructed according to false stereotypes; e.g. labelling certain work as women’s or men’s work. \n" +
            "Second, is simply when we define our stereotypes too narrowly or widely to make them useful. An example of the former is defining a chair as having four legs. Why can’t a chair have three or four? An example of the latter would be defining a chair as something that can be sat on. Well a tree trunk can be sat upon. \n" +
            "In conclusion, stereotypes are useful but should not be used lazily.\n","Dear Sir / Madam , \n" +

However , during the evening , after the TV had been on for a couple of hours , a line started to appear across the centre of the screen . I tried changing channels but the line did not go away . At this time , the sound from the television became a little distorted . This was about 3 days ago now and since then the problem has got worse .

They have made communication easy and cheap between friends , family and businesses . The phones are not only used for speech and text messages but increasingly to browse the internet , to read email , to play games or to pay for products . In many countries , particularly those with slow network connections , the internet is something that happens on a mobile phone rather than on a computer . \n" +
            "There are also disadvantages to using mobile phones . One is the potential health risk . While the information is not conclusive some people living near to mobile phone transmitters report higher rates of cancer then elsewhere . Keeping a powerful device transmitting waves and heat next to your ear for long periods of time may be harmful to heavy users of mobile phones . There are also social problems related to mobile phone use . Walking around with a phone glued to your ear may prevent you from interacting with other people while anti-social use on public transport or in the cinema has led to many public environments , such as theatres and cinemas , requesting users to switch their phones off or to silent . There are also technical issues with mobile phone use .

            "The idea of tasks being shared equally between parents contains several assumptions . One assumption is that both parents have equal amounts of available time and are both available to do what is required at the time it is required . Clearly this is often not the case . If , for example , a child needs help with some homework one evening and one parent is required to work late , the task falls to the other parent . Therefore , despite genuine attempts to share duties equally , it will not always be practically possible to do so . \n" +
            "The second assumption which is implied by the idea of sharing tasks equally is that both parents are equally well prepared or skilled to do all tasks . Again this is clearly not the case most of the time . For instance , it may be that the mother is a teacher and able to provide the kind of support the child needs with their homework more effectively than the father . \n" +
            "In theory , perhaps the best approach would be to first decide what the child needs at any given time , and secondly to assess which parent is in the best position to provide this need . This approach is aimed at using the parental resources most effectively , rather than 'equally' . \n" +
            "In conclusion , it would seem that the 'equality' point of view may not always be in the child's best " +
            "interest . A more effective approach might be for couples to agree on how they can best use their resources . Even if this is accomplished however it is unlikely to be achievable constantly due to practical restraints .\n","We often hear that new technology is in conflict with our traditions . The new is replacing the old . Are there any ways however in which new technology can help support our traditions and help keep them alive ? \n" +
            "First of all , it seems that technology can help preserve our traditions by providing a channel of education for them . For instance , the Internet is now an established provider of education . From a good website we can learn a lot about our past and our traditions . This can be brought to us in interesting ways if the website has interactive learning activities . In addition , this technology can be made available in our schools , and homes , quite easily . \n" +
            "A second way in which today's technology can help is by keeping us informed . Our traditions are kept alive by us continuing to carry them out and celebrate them . Again as a result of the Internet , and mobile phones , it has never been easier to inform people of upcoming events and to spread the news to a large number of people quickly , easily and at little cost . \n" +
            "Finally , it could be argued that modern technology saves us time . We can do a lot of tasks much more quickly than in the past . In theory therefore we should have more time to devote to traditional activities . Whether we choose to do so or not however rests with the individual . \n" +
            "In conclusion , there would seem to be several ways in which new technology can help us to preserve our " +
            "traditions particularly by educating and informing us . As in many other aspects of our life however , " +
            "it is up to us if we decide to employ the technology in this way or not .\n","For all the people who " +
            "feel sad buying the OnePlus 5.....I still use my OnePlus 3T ( although i can afford any phone  on the planet ) WHICH after 1 year is as fast as when I bought it. People are unnecessarily Upgrading & wasting money. Before buying, Upgrading ask yourself this. Is your phone working just fine ? Is there a need to upgrade to the latest ? Now you buy OnePlus 5T & 2 months later Samsung in January will announce galaxy S9 in Mobile World Congress. And then you'll feel the SAME WAY as you feel NOW. Then after you buy it, OnePlus releases OnePlus 6 in May/June & will want to buy it. And then a few months later, the iPhone 11 & OnePlus 6T arrive. My point is, if your phone is working perfectly, just stick with it & be content. This is a never ending process by companies to milk the money out of customers. I have seen very successful & rich people still using their iPhone 7+/6S+. When asked why, they simply said \"it's working fine\". And they replied in such a way as if they DIDN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT such a small thing. Tells you something about WHY they're successful in the 1st place doesn't it ? Be content with what you have as long as it's getting the job done. And focus on MORE productive things .\n","I am writing to request your authorisation to attend a 5 day seminar on *effective ways of improving written communication* *within the Health Insurance Sector* as instructed by my team leader Mrs. Murray.

            "After working for over 3 years in the operations team and having participated of various cross departments  meetings, I have noticed that communication issues are still at the core of the delay in resolving client’s problems promptly. Therefore, I strongly believe that attending this course will boost my confidence at work as it will provide me with extra tools to understand and tackle this issue. \n" +

The results of the survey are presented below together with recommendations on how to solve existing problems. \n" +
            "Mugging and assault \n" +
            "Physical violence is the most frequent crime being committed in the area. 20% of those questioned reported having been either assaulted or mugged. Young people complain of certain areas to be  particularly dangerous due to the absence of proper lighting and reliable security. Therefore, it is advised that additional street lamps and surveillance cameras should be installed and police patrolling the streets should be organized. \n" +
            "Drug dealing and gangs \n" +
            "Another problem that the community is facing is that of drug dealing. It is rooted most likely in the gang activity in the town. The members of the gang choose their targets among schoolchildren and students – 10% of the latter confirmed either being offered drugs or having seen others being offered To stop it, we suggest monitoring the gang more closely and making arrests whenever drug dealing is suspected to take  place. Besides creating comfortable conditions for people to be able to report drug dealing safely and anonymously could also help in eradicating the danger.\n" +
            "Conclusion\n" +
            "The survey showed that on the whole young people are reluctant to consider the area safe, which means " +
            "that high crime rates and their causes should be investigated further for more sufficient details. Meanwhile, safety measures suggested above could be implemented to change the situation for the better as quickly as possible. We hope that this report will receive your serious consideration and necessary steps will be taken in the near future.","Cars are one of the most popular means of transport nowadays. They are used everywhere in the world by people of different income, age, social status and occupation. This essay deals with the question of driving a car, summarizing and evaluating the ideas expressed in the texts above. \n" +
            "Both texts speak about personal transport, but they analyze the question from different angles. The first passage rises  the problem of traffic congestion and names two possible ways to solve it: restrictions on speed limits and parking on the one hand, and promoting alternative means of transport on the other. The ideas expressed in the text are certainly true for large cities where traffic jams are one of the biggest concerns. However, the situation in small towns and rural areas is totally different: the problem of congestion does not exist there and thus does not need to be solved. \n" +
            "Unlike the first text, the second one looks on  the positive side of driving. Calling driving a  most " +
            "popular means of transport and providing statistics to prove it, the text gives the reason for cars popularity. According to the passage, having a personal vehicle gives people a (-) freedom of choice and a way to express themselves – things which outweigh all the disadvantages like  high cost and traffic inconveniences. It is hard to argue that driving a car is popular, but I believe that its popularity is rather due to comfort than to human psychology.","The impact of the media on teenagers\n" +
            "Nowadays it has become almost impossible to ignore the media due to the fact that most of us spend some daily time either watching television, listening to the radio or surfing the internet. Specially teenagers who spend a significant part of the day exposed to all types of advertisement. Advertisers consider that teenagers are the perfect target, while some people believe that teenagers have changed marketing worldwide.\n" +
            "Who manipulates who? That is the dilemma.\n" +
            "On one hand, the marketing and advertisement industry look upon the young generations as the easiest people to influence. Making them believe that certain items are the key to popularity is the strategy they have developed to sell among that generation.\n" +
            "On the other hand, some people believe that advertising responds to young peoples‘ desires and not the other way around. It is the energy of teenagers that has had a huge impact on this industry, making it more innovative and creative. The power of young people have push advertising boundaries to become almost an art form more sophisticated and attractive than ever before.\n" +
            "All in all, there has been a revolution in the adversiment industry globally. While some people may be " +
            "influenced by it, some others may deﬁne trends. Ten years ago people were not so worried about material offered by the media. Globalization has changed everything, advertising has become part of our daily lives and it is unavoidable. The temptation surround us, some of us fall for it.","Concern is often expressed about the negative effects that television can have on young people. As far as l am concerned, the rnost serious damage that occurs is a result of the constant commercial pressures that vulnerable youngsters are exposed to.\n" +
            "Advertisernents every ten minutes or so as children and teenagers watch their favourite programmes are likely to lead them to believe that possessing the latest gadget or item of clothing will bring them happiness and respect from others. To my mind, the result ofthis can only be a generation whose values are too materialistic for their own ultimate contentment.\n" +
            "This is not to say that all advertisements are lacking in quality. It is not unreasonable, in fact, to consider them as an art forrn as many are imaginative and make original use of language, music and camerawork.\n" +
            "They are indeed often produced bytalented young people who ﬁnd them an appropriate focus for their own creativity.\n" +
            "ln my opinion, the answer lies in education. Advertisements are not harmful per se; it isjust that we " +
            "all need to know how to use them. We should take the information that we need from them but we should be aware of the techniques that their makers use with the hope of influencing us to buy things we do not really have any need of. Young people should be taught not only to appreciate the artistic qualities of adverts but also to recognize the tricks that are being employed. Greater sophistication should lead to less vulnerability.\n","The televised national event to be dealt with in this report is the royal wedding that took place in London in 2O11. It was the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton. The ceremony took place in Westminster Abbey and was a spectacular occasion with plenty of ancient gilded carriages, men in uniforms hung with medals and ladies in extravagant hats. The British media makes a great fuss of such occasions and there had been considerable press interest in the event from the moment the couple's engagement was announced.\n" +
            "On the day there was TV coverage of the wedding from start to finish. The public saw the streams of guests arriving. They could watch the groom nervously talking to his brother before the ceremony. They were shown the bride leaving her central London hotel. They saw the entire ceremony and the procession afterwards. The TV coverage could be said to have made the public feel as if they were in a sense wedding guests themselves.\n" +
            "In general, TV did help this wedding to create a mood of national celebration. There was so much on TV " +
            "in the days leading up to the wedding that many people were tired of it before it had even begun. However, once the ceremony itself started it was hard not to be drawn into it. This was a royal wedding but it had an ordinary feel to it somehow. Despite the cameras the central figures appeared relaxed and made their vows without faltering. They giggled slightly as the groom struggled to get the ring on his bride’s finger: lt felt less stiff than previous televised royal weddings perhaps because the bride was a middle—class girl from a family that it was easier for most people to relate to than had usually been the case with royal spouses. Viewers were moved by this wedding and the way it symbolised — as all weddings do — love and hope.","Shakespeare in Love is a romantic comedy that circles around the forbidden love of William Shakespeare and Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant. The relationship between Will and Viola is based in poetry and inspiration making it strong and interesting.\n" +
            "First of all, Viola appears to be in love not only with Shakespeare but with his powerful writing as well. We can clearly see this in the scene when a play is performed for the Queen and Viola attends it, she whispers the lines written by Will being absorbed by them and loving every word of his poetry, before even falling in love with him. Viola is attracted to Will as they have a common passion for poetry and theatre. We can see her devotion to both when she forces Will out of bed to write the next page for them to practice that day.\n" +
            "Moreover, at the beginning of the screenplay we see Will searching for a muse, characteristically referring to it to Henslowe as “an emptiness that seeks a soulmate” when he desperately asks for his pages. However, falling in love with Viola is the answer to his “writer's block\", as through their forbidden love he finds the inspiration and weaves his life into the plot of “Romeo and Juliet”. Consequently, many of his and Viola’s quotes take their part in the play Will is writing, as captured in the bedroom scene. The inspiration he draws from Viola is unreplaceable and that is what makes their love so deep and passionate.\n" +
            "To conclude, Will and Viola both make their dreams come true through this love, for Viola is being an " +
            "actress, something forbidden for women at the time, for Will it is writing a powerful play and becoming " +
            "a significant playwrite. Their love arms them with everything necessary to fulfil these ambitions and live passionately for the time they are together.\n","Internist Gail Povar has many female patients making their way through menopause, some having a tougher time than others. Several women with similar stories stand out in her mind. Each came to Povar’s Silver Spring, Md., office within a year or two of stopping her period, complaining of frequent hot flashes and poor sleep at night. “They just felt exhausted all the time,” Povar says. “The joy had kind of gone out.”\n" +
            "And all of them “were just absolutely certain that they were not going to take hormone replacement,” she says. But the women had no risk factors that would rule out treating their symptoms with hormones. So Povar suggested the women try hormone therapy for a few months. “If you feel really better and it makes a big difference in your life, then you and I can decide how long we continue it,” Povar told them. “And if it doesn’t make any difference to you, stop it.”\n" +
            "At the follow-up appointments, all of these women reacted the same way, Povar recalls. “They walked in beaming, absolutely beaming, saying, ‘I can’t believe I didn’t do this a year ago. My life! I’ve got my life back.’ ”\n" +
            "That doesn’t mean, Povar says, that she’s pushing hormone replacement on patients. “But it should be on the table,” she says. “It should be part of the discussion.”\n" +
            "Hormone replacement therapy toppled off the table for many menopausal women and their doctors in 2002. That’s when a women’s health study, stopped early after a data review, published results linking a common hormone therapy to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots. The trial, part of a multifaceted project called the Women’s Health Initiative, or WHI, was meant to examine hormone therapy’s effectiveness in lowering the risk of heart disease and other conditions in women ages 50 to 79. It wasn’t a study of hormone therapy for treating menopausal symptoms.\n" +
            "But that nuance got lost in the coverage of the study’s results, described at the time as a “bombshell,”" +
            " a call to get off of hormone therapy right away. Women and doctors in the United States heeded the call. A 2012 study in Obstetrics & Gynecology showed that use plummeted: Oral hormone therapy, taken by an estimated 22 percent of U.S. women 40 and older in 1999–2000, was taken by fewer than 12 percent of women in 2003–2004. Six years later, the number of women using oral hormone therapy had sunk below 5 percent.\n","Now there’s a way to tell if a drone is spying on someone.\n" +
            "Researchers have devised a method to tell what a drone is recording — without having to decrypt the video data that the device streams to the pilot’s smartphone. This technique, described January 9 at arXiv.org, could help military bases detect unwanted surveillance and civilians protect their privacy as more commercial drones take to the skies.\n" +
            "“People have already worked on detecting [the presence of] drones, but no one had solved the problem of, ‘Is the drone actually recording something in my direction?’” says Ahmad Javaid, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Toledo in Ohio, who was not involved in the work.\n" +
            "Ben Nassi, a software engineer at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and colleagues realized that changing the appearance of objects in a drone’s field of view influences the stream of encrypted data the drone sends to its smartphone controller. That’s because the more pixels that change from one video frame to the next, the more data bits the drone sends per second. So rapidly switching the appearance of a person or house and seeing whether those alterations correspond to higher drone-to-phone Wi-Fi traffic can reveal whether a drone is snooping.  \n" +
            "Nassi’s team tested this idea by covering a house window with a smart film that could switch between transparent and nearly opaque, and aiming a drone with a video camera at the window from 40 meters away. Every two seconds, the researchers either flickered the smart film back and forth or left it transparent. They pointed a radio frequency scanner at the drone to intercept its outgoing Wi-Fi signals and found that its traffic spiked whenever the smart film flickered.\n","Time management is one of my priorities. Sometimes I have to try hard to save time for just a quiet evening with a good book. I don’t like traditional shopping very much, for me it’s generally a waste of time and a fight with vendors who try to impose something on you. Thank goodness we have such life-hack websites as Ozon.ru and Bonprix.\n" +
            "“Ozon” used to be an Internet bookstore, but now it’s more of a mega mall where you can buy almost everything. Apart from books, CDs and DVDs there are shoes, clothes, cosmetics, food and whatnot. When I needed a new drill and a screwdriver, they delivered them to my door for free, because I am a loyal customer. A week ago I bought a healthy snack bar in the gym, which was quite expensive, but then I found the same kind on Ozon.ru. It was a real bargain and I bought two boxes! Once I took a risk and bought an item of clothing - the result was perfect. The shirt fitted, the colour suited, and I decided to take the next step.\n" +
            "Bonprix is the website for clothes shopping. Some might consider buying clothes online too strange, but I can assure you just need some experience. For me, the problem was to find plain, basic clothes. The necessity to deal with vendors who are not much interested in your needs made me sick, and I took the plunge. Now I just go to Bonprix website, browse and pick. Sizes are correct most of thetimes but you can always return or exchange a piece of clothing if something is wrong. I myself never tried to do so though, didn’t have to.\n" +
            "Both the websites provide a delivery to a PickPoint postal machine. Those machines are everywhere, and you can collect your order when convenient. So, I would encourage everyone to use those two websites.","Dear Sir or Madam\n" +
            "I am writing to complain about the bad standard of accommodation during my last holiday. I booked this self-catering holiday last year in your travel agency. When I returned from my two-week travel last week, I immediately visited the agency to complain about my bad experiences.\n" +
            "Had I known that the accomodation would be so poor, I would have booked from the beginning a full-service holiday. What I expected was a luxury apartment with a small oven. Not only was the room dirty and full of bugs, but the shower was broken and unusable. To make matters even worse, there was no oven as I ordered it. Never before have I seen such a bad service at a self-catering holiday. You can imagine my anger when I had to eat out, smelling like a ... Not surprisingly, I booked another room, though without oven but clean and with a working shower. Therefore this room cost a lot more than the other one and I had to go out eating.\n" +
            "My purpose in visiting the agency was to ask for compensation. The young lady who served me offered some vouchers as compensation. She advised me to take my time with the answer. I have decided to ask your company for a cash refund. Would a refund about 500 euros be too much to expect? I would like to ask you to have a look on my enclosed accounts. Seeing how much money I had to invest additionally will help you to decide what to do about the whole matter.\n" +
            "At the very least, I would like you to inform me of the action you will take with regard tomy extra invested money. Unless adequate action is taken, I shall have no other option but to publish this letter in the local newspaper.","Dear Sir / Madam ,\n" +
            "I read in last week’s edition of the White Horse News that you are keen to reward local people who have made significant contributions to the community . I would like to put my mother , Mrs . Gillian Summerton , forward for this reward .\n" +
            "My mother is a schoolteacher , and has done much to enrich the lives of the young people in her care . In her free time , she continues to give up her time to help people . She runs a ladies’ choir which is a superb opportunity for local women to get together and enjoy themselves . Moreover , the choir performs free of charge at charity events , and consequently my mother has been fundamental in both raising large sums of money and bringing pleasure to people .\n" +
            "I know that my mother does not need a financial reward for her services to the community , as it gives her a lot of pleasure . However , I’m sure that she would appreciate formal recognition for her work , perhaps in the form of a donation to her preferred charity , the Red Cross .\n" +

            "Pedro.","Mobile phones have transformed the lives of nearly everyone on the planet in the last few years . They have made communication easy and cheap between friends , family and businesses . The phones are not only used for speech and text messages but increasingly to browse the internet , to read email , to play games or to pay for products . In many countries , particularly those with slow network connections , the internet is something that happens on a mobile phone rather than on a computer .\n" +
            "There are also disadvantages to using mobile phones . One is the potential health risk . While the information is not conclusive some people living near to mobile phone transmitters report higher rates of cancer then elsewhere . Keeping a powerful device transmitting waves and heat next to your ear for long periods of time may be harmful to heavy users of mobile phones . There are also social problems related to mobile phone use . Walking around with a phone glued to your ear may prevent you from interacting with other people while anti-social use on public transport or in the cinema has led to many public environments , such as theatres and cinemas , requesting users to switch their phones off or to silent . There are also technical issues with mobile phone use . Many areas do not have network connectivity and the reliability or audio quality of the mobile service in other areas may fall well short of that provided by a landline .\n" +
            "Significant those these drawbacks may be , the huge convenience of the mobile phone will ensure that its use continues to change our lives.","Our modern life often poses us a question – what is acceptable in terms of behaviour considering the fast pace at which modern society changes. Besides, the shift towards the cult of individuality has been obvious for the past years.\n" +
            "Nowadays, we are all aware of the fact that society is made up of different generations each of which has their own preferences and habits deeply ingrained in their consciousness. In this connection the generation gap is considered to be a perennial problem. It is a well-known fact younger generations are more technologically advanced than the previous ones, moreover the young are quicker on the uptake and more resilient to ever changing demands of our life. Despite that, I am inclined to believe that only by being tolerant to each other and accepting the right of each generation to adhere to their own set of beliefs and ideas we will be able to peacefully co-exist in society.\n" +
            "At last society has recognised the need for each member to be an individual. Throughout the history of humanity members of society have had to fit the mould and conform to the set of principles and beliefs accepted. For example, even 50 years ago woman’s only domain was household chores. Nowadays, we are relieved to see that women are equal members of society fulfilling their potential and rising thru the ranks. Some of them even manage to achieve dizzy heights.\n" +
            "In conclusion, our society is moving forward by leaps and bounds, patterns of behaviour and social norms are changing as well. So, only by coming to terms with the above-mentioned we, all members of it, won’t be deemed  as misfits and relish our existence in the society.","The first considers the fact that different groups of society have different ideas about what is acceptable behaviour. What is normal for one set of people may appear rude to another group. This text makes the point that it is important to appreciate that others may have differing viewpoints, claiming that such awareness can help to avoid social conflicts. The second text looks at the issue from a contrasting angle. It argues against the desirability of behaving in socially acceptable ways. Its contention is that being too concerned about social conventions stifles individuality and may even have a negative effect on our own psychological health.\n" +
            "In my opinion, there is little to disagree with in the first text. It is an undeniable fact that behavioural norms vary across generations, classes and cultures and it is also true that understanding and tolerance provide the soundest basis for our approach to social difference.\n" +
            "The second text is possibly more contentious. While it may be the case that some people are over-concerned about etiquette and unimportant social rules, I feel that some conventions for social behaviour have a positive impact on everyone’s lives. It all depends on the type of rule. I do not feel that it is important to know whichway you ‘should’ tip your bowl when eating soup or when you should or shouldn’t wear gloves but I do think itis desirable to say please and thank you and to behave in a considerate way towards one’s fellows. In other words, I think that basic social conventions serve a useful purpose but that they should be used to oil our interactions rather than becoming too much of an end in themselves.","One of the most intriguing books I have read recently is \"11/22/63\" by Stephen King, published only a few years ago. Not being especially enthusiastic neither about the author nor the science-fiction genre, I was instantly hooked regardless.\n" +
            "The story is set both in the present and the 1960s with the main character Jake Epping setting out to prevent the assassination of JFK. Jake Epping is an ordinary English teacher at a high school in Maine, divorced, no kids. As a time traveller he is determined to honor the pledge he made to his dying friend to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from shooting the 35th president.\n" +
            "Not only does Jake's initial and rather spontaneous decision to step back in time reflect traits of his character, but it also influences the unfolding action fundamentally.  Judging from his behavior in this critical moment as well as in key situations later in the plot, Epping seems to be a decisive, brave, loyal and responsible kind of person. However, he repeatedly risks his mission and altering the future radically by first falling in love with a woman named Sadie Dunhill and then feeling recurrently tempted to spill all his secrets to her. The book ends with Epping putting the world's fate first and his feelings and personal happiness last.\n" +
            "In conclusion, I think the book paints quite a positive and heroic picture of its protagonist. While I do not feel uncomfortable with this approach, I deem the ending rather exaggerated in terms of Epping's altruism.","For many years, people had a dream about space voyages. Such significant events as the first human space flight, first step on the surface of the moon and first hug of the participants of the International Soyuz-Apollo space mission, have become milestones in the history of space exploration. It was a major breakthrough for science and now we can’t imagine our life without modern communication facilities such as satellite television or broadcasting systems.\n" +
            "Nowadays, the International Space Station has become the main platform for scientific discoveries and the science lab where scientists from many countries do their collaborative work. It is not only the celestial bodies that are being observed by an international body of scientists but also experiments. For many scientists the only place where exact results could be achieved is this space laboratory. Without a doubt, this is the question of vital importance for physicists, microbiologists and other experts on natural sciences.\n" +
            "One of the greatest advantages of the International Space Station is that it accepts space tourists. A few space travelers have already been there. This fact draws our attention to another benefit of space exploration. It is the strong possibility of life in space, which we have seen before in science fiction movies, where people did interstellar trips taking space crafts like we take trains, buses or taxis. While it is true that people need more space for living, we shouldn’t forget that the main problem is unequal density of population on our planet. Some regions are very overcrowded whereas the other are almost deserted or spoiled by the negative activity of people.\n" +
            "Having weighted both sides of this issue, it is important to know how to rectify the situation with the environmental problems. one of the main risks of investing money in finding additional living space for people is that we can’t afford this funding, it is too expensive for us now. Therefore we should focus on scientific researches in space to further our knowledge about the universe and the elements. We also should study the influence of these elements on our planet and be aware of how to make our life on our wonderful blue planet better.","At the last moment of this year, I recall my memory of those performances of the year. It is surprising that there were numbers of events in my local area, which I was neglecting to take part in. Although I failed to make an effort to visit the events, I particularly liked the art exhibition that was on the central library.\n" +
            "The title of the exhibition was 'Local Amateur artist'. As the title is, it wasn't professional but local people's crafts or some amateurs' over due exhibition.\n" +
            "I liked the atmosphere of the exhibition that was close to public, which was different from so-called novelty exhibitions. It was opened to normal people who didn't have much chance to experience artists' works or even who doesn't know how to draw or paint.\n" +
            "I found out they were various from simple pencil drawings to heavy oil paintings. Any kinds of arts were exhibited unless it was too childish to call it art. Consequently, this event provided us with closer environment of the art. That was a common feeling with others who could share their feeling of the arts by exposing their own art works.\n" +
            "They were imaginative or rather creative without any imitating previous artists work, which was very pleasant to look around, even more surprising and fresh so that I could amuse myself with looking at the creative crafts.\n" +
            "Although the exhibition hadn't been for a long time as it was taking one corner of the library, it might have helped anyone get interested in art, feel it and understand it.","Hi Kim\n" +
            "Great to hear from you! I’m so sorry I won’t be able to be around when you arrive. I really have to go to that compulsory further training I told you about. I wish I could see you and your gorgeous little family. But I’m sure you guys will have a great time here in Chur! So, which restaurant should I recommend you.\n" +
            "I would probably go for the 'Sommerau'. Just been there last week. They’ve got a huge terrace and a nice little playground outside. Your kids would be happy to play there after eating some really good food. The restaurant is famous for cooking extravagant seasonal dishes. But they serve you whatever you want. Of course they’ve got some awesome extra kids-menus. I really love the friendly staff there and the lovely arranged food always makes me super-happy. The only drawback might be the prices. They are a little higher than elsewhere, but I’d say it well worth it.\n" +
            "The other great tipp is the 'Akrusi'. It’s kind of a fast food restaurant but slightly different. They do not sell burgers but all kind of sausages, salads and pasta. Kids love it! You do get special offers for families and the food is really fantastic. I highly recommend the avocado-mint-salad.\n" +
            "Well, I hope you do like one of those and wish you an enjoyable day! Give my love to your family!\n" +

            "I am writing to express my annoyance at your restaurant yesterday. I chose your restarurant to invite three of my important business clients, reading \"Best Restaurants in Britain 2000\", but the reality was far from its recommendation.\n" +
            "First, as stated in the guide book, you have a variety of course meals in the menu. However, only 2 for meat and 1 for fish were on offer yesterday. This deeply dissapointed my guests. Therefore, we chose starter, main dish and dessert à la carte, but it was not very easy. Many were unavailable; e.g. we did not have any choices other than onion soup and seafood salad for starter.\n" +
            "Furthermore, the meals were not served at the same time. About five minutes after a rump steak was put on the table for one of my clients, any of others had not been served yet. Therefore, he had to start alone. I asked your staff to bring all the other meals soon and in another five minutes only two, including my grilled salmon, were brought to us. When the other one, steamed trout, was put on the table, the client who had a rump steak had almost finished.\n" +
            "Finally, the beef steak my client had was overcooked, although he asked for a medium-cooked.\n" +
            "On paying the bill, I complained about this inconvenience to your head waiter, but he asked me to contact you directly in writing. I feel that a refund of at least £200, which is half of our payment, would be appropriate. I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply within 14 days.\n" +

Ten years ago I was a university teacher of Computer Science and things went great but I lived with my family in the Hotel for Scientist.

I graduated Technical University of Wroclaw, Department of Foreign Languages and the Academy of Economics, Department of Computer Science with Master degree.\n" +

            "First of all, we were given a table just in front of the toilets because there was not any other available, although we had booked it in advance. Furthermore, we were forced to leave at 10 p.m because someone else had also booked the same table.\n" +
            "Secondly, we had to wait for nearly half an hour to be served and after the long waiting we were obliged to change our minds and ask for meat because there was no lobster left. In fact, only three out of the seven main courses were available.\n" +
            "I would also like to point out the incompetence of the service because the waiter spilled the sauce over my husband´s dish even though we had asked him not to do so.\n" +
            "To make matters worse, there was no response when I asked to meet the manager of the restaurant so I have been forced to write to make you know about these unfortunate incidents.\n" +
            "I very much hope that in future you will take care of these mistakes in order to prevent them and I am afraid to say that I will have no alternative but to put the matter in the hands of my solicitors should not I receive compensation within the next few days.\n" +

We have different kinds of saunas there as well, if you fancy. As it is winter already, visiting the waterpark can be a nice opportunity to relax and warm your bones a little.\n" +

            "Julia.","Many parents, struggle with bringing up their child into be responsible adults and are unsure how to influence them. There are of course, many ways of influencing young adults, and I want to present and discuss two of them: giving rules to obey and offering your children advice.\n" +
            "First of all, it has to be said that advice is easy to ignore, and that children especially in their adolescent years, don’t even want advice, and will tell you so, too: ‘I don’t need your help’, they will say to you or even shout at you. Kids often feel misunderstood they think their parents can’t understand them, because they are ‘too old’. If your son or daughter has a problem, it is important to make him or her feel that you do understand and only want their best and are, therefore, offering some advice, hoping it will help them. Then again, there are rules. Rules can be placed differently, they don’t need to be a stone-hard barrier to your child’s freedom. Adolescents will often bend rules or utterly break them all because they need this certain feeling of rebellion and freedom. Rules also help the maturing of the conscience. If a child doesn’t need to follow rules, it’s conscience will never mature and it will not know wrong from right. If, however you place rules, and punishments should they not be followed, your son or daughter will learn not to steal, to be home on time simply because he or she doesn’t want to be punished. Don’t overdo it, though. Placing too hard punishments could also lead to destruction of the conscience your child never being able to make it’s own decisions.\n" +
            "I think that giving rules to obey is the best way of influencing young people. Wherever you go, you find certain rules. Not every rule is absolutely sensible, but while growing older, your child will learn by itself which rules should be followed and will follow them of free choice.","Introduction.\n" +
            "I come through this letter to make an appeal for the not destruction of the Municipal Library’s building.\n" +
            "Historical Interests\n" +
            "One of the reasons why the building should be preserved is because of its touching past. It was built with only imported material of best quality, and it was the second library in the country. It was also, for more than a hundred years, the biggest and more luxuous public building in the whole country. For its characteristic seventeenth century building and for its importance in the past, it is still studied and visited by historians.\n" +
            "Benefits for Community The building is located right in the middle of the town, so it is accessible for the entire population, and it is also the biggest building in town, and it can surely support more books than any other building.\n" +
            "By destructing the building it would with absolutly no doubt be a huge loss of books and culture.\n" +
            "Improvements\n" +
            "There is no point arguing that the building is quite old-fashioned and could use some improvements. It could really use some painting and repairing on the wall and floor, however, the best would be making some technological improvements, such as elevatiors, computers and an electronic “finding books” system.\n" +
            "Conclusion\n" +
            "To sum up, there are plenty of reasons why the library should be preserved, it benefits the people, the history and the culture, and I would be pleased if you took my letter in consideration.","Have you ever thought of yourself sitting under a palmier tree with a long drink and with an endless tourquise-green water in front of you?\n" +
            "I’ve got this experience of my life last year when my husband and me decided to have a dream holiday and we chose Dominican Republic, more specific Punta Cana as our destination.\n" +
            "We have to choose from a lot of resorts, but finnaly we made up our mind for Palladium Resort which is an enormous, stunning complex of villas, all having their own terrace.\n" +
            "There are six restaurants with their specific and open-bars all over the place, but ‘the piece of resistence’ is the pool – big, clean, with chaise longs directly in the water and, of course, with its own bar. If you’ll come at Palladium, it’s a must.\n" +
            "I have the chance to try scuba-diving and I can tell you that it was the most thrilling moment of mine. Swimming along with lots of tiny creatures of the sea, seeing one sheep?? sinked and transformed into a refugee ?? for small fish, not to mention the corals, was a dream-life come true.\n" +
            "There are also lots of places to visit, like cacao and coffee farms in the mountains where you arrive in big, old trucks with their engines working accordingly. It’s an experience that is worthwhile – full of flavours, colours and joy. Also, you can learn something about the history of the island. Small children are offering you flowers and they lead the way to the farms for a penny.\n" +
            "Only a weak point – there were few chaiselongues on the beach, but apart from that, I can tell you – is a dream holiday.","I think that'd be an uphill battle.\n" +
            "E.g., I, for one, oppose federal interference with the technical decisions of ISPs via so-called net neutrality. I've written my representatives on multiple occasions saying so. If I lived in Montana, I'd be similarly opposed to the state government's meddling. As a citizen of Minnesota, I'd actually oppose an overreaching federal government if they tried to overturn Montana's law. Even though I think it'd be better policy for Montanans, I regard Montana's rights as a state as more important than my ego's desire to direct their policy from afar.\n" +
            "My guess is that a lot of other opponents of federal internet regulation would agree.\n" +
            "I'm actually quite glad to see this playing out among the various states as 'laboratories of democracy'. In ten years, we'll both have a lot more data on which policy promotes better offerings.\n" +
            "What I'd really like to see is one of the states declare municipal grants of telecommunications monopolies to be void. E.g., if some town has contracted with Comcast to be the only ISP legally allowed, then the state would come in and say that those terms are legally unenforceable and that the town has to license at least one or two competitors or face charges from the state.","As a type-1 diabetic of 17 years now, I can confirm that the price of Insulin has been steadily rising over the years.\n" +
            "I can also state that the majority of my medical expenses go to insulin pump supplies, not insulin itself. On average, I'm paying roughly $250/mo out of pocket, after 90% insurance coverage for the whole diabetic kit-and-kaboodle. I would be quite troubled if I were to lose my job and/or medical insurance. Thinking about the future, it's definitely a fear of being in a circumstance where I will be without supplies for any amount of time.\n" +
            "As another commenter noted, and got down-voted instantly, a large cause of the insulin usage increase (and therefore pump increases) is due to a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetics.\n" +
            "Depending on where you're treated, many type-1 diabetics are given a rather thorough crash course on the disease (and it's symptom-based-cousin, type-2, for comparison). In my opinion at least, I don't feel like many type-2 diabetics are given as much information, or are potentially more reluctant to absorb it.\n" +
            "It's a broad generalization, but not necessarily inaccurate, to state that most type-2 patients rely on medicines to treat their symptoms and will not adjust their diets even under the worst case scenario. Type-2 in many ways can have it's symptoms reduced/resolved by something akin to a keto diet. That said, sugar is ridiculously hard to quit.","Given that good management can have such a dramatic effect on the efficiency of this style of burger joint, this may well be a good investment for the company. I remember once going into a McDonald's, and seeing an absolutely de-optimized crew. Basically, they seemed to be trying to all use the same station at the same time, trying to maximize the length of the queue formed and minimize throughput. It literally took me 10 minutes to get a burger.\n" +
            "Of course, this also applies to the workers under the manager as well. My wife drives me crazy in this way. There are some people who will interact in a group by modeling the future pathways, tasks, and schedule of everyone around them, then navigate those models to avoid conflict in time and space. Then there are some people who can't. As far as I can tell, my wife doesn't have a fine-grained enough internal sense of time to be able to do that. I almost stopped dating her early on, because she once kept me waiting 45 minutes in front of the locked door of her apartment, because she was having a conversation with her CEO. I also recall a recent instance cooking with her in the kitchen, and was rinsing 3 pieces of raw meat -- she interrupted me between piece 2 and piece 3 and left me hanging there with contaminated hands while she washed/processed an entire leek. I also remember a band-mate of mine who couldn't \"add time\" in her head when travelling to gigs, so would always be late. (I know this is the specific case from conversations while planning to drive somewhere.)\n" +
            "It was a very good lesson on how job satisfaction doesn't need fancy cafés, ball pits and slides.\n" +
            "I think one of the best possible rewards is \"good working.\" When people really mesh, there can even be a high.","I'm a strong believer in using minimal but sufficient regulations and taxes to shape market growth.\n" +
            "There are some absolutely unnecessary regulations, like the loopholes Tesla has to go through to sell cars because traditional dealerships don't want to lose money, or unfair taxes against green energy - protectionism must die.\n" +
            "There are also outdated but reasonable regulations, like Seattle's density regulations. Our housing crisis is caused by the market lagging far behind economic growth because it took years for the public to recognize the city was growing, years to change the laws, and then more years for the normal construction timeline. Density regulations as a concept make sense, but we haven't figured out how to auto-scale limits to avoid falling behind.\n" +
            "And then there are areas where we do need more regulations. For example, we absolutely need more regulations on credit cards and loans in addition to better finance education in highschool. Consumers are responsible for being informed, but there's still no excuse for even offering to saddle someone with a high-interest loan that they can never hope to pay off... some people are simply too dumb to understand the math.\n" +
            "I like the phrase \"evidence-based regulations\", but sometimes the evidence is stale or measuring the wrong thing, and the data doesn't guarantee we implement the right system of incentives.","Most of those innovations however seem to be playing \"catch-up\" though and there's a huge question mark as to whether most (not necessarily all) of the benefit goes to capital holders. Even the innovations that do benefit as a percentage how much do they lift living standards by compared to innovations of old? Electricity meant I had light at night; think of your local neighborhood without sewerage, etc.\n" +
            "They are also \"costing a lot more\" in terms of training and intelligence so there's a question mark of how much the average person without capital or privilege can access them. For me there's also a question of whether they are just playing catch up for increase in human population that's happened since the WW2 era - how many are not required if we just reduce population? Per capita are we really better of? There's a reason a lot of people are \"nostalgic\" for the period before the 1990's. There's also the negative things to consider of all this \"innovation\" such as environmental degradation, the massive increase in CO2 emissions, etc.\n" +
            "The \"stagnant\" economy (e.g food, land, health care) - the things most people need to survive comfortably have been increasing in cost significantly for most world economies. The innovations you state most of the world's population (who are mostly poor btw) would happily trade away for cheap more nutrient rich food, house, cheaper energy, etc.\n" +
            "Not saying hyperloops, blockchains and such aren't cool; I'm just questioning whether technology alone is what improves our quality of life. And all technology requires energy which is generally increasing in cost.","So this actually points to a big problem with how we measure growth.\n" +
            "If you start from the assumption that well-being or some other desirable policy goal can be measured by income (profits, wages, etc), I'd argue most of the things in this list aren't likely to increase either wages or profits of companies.\n" +
            "But they are likely to create economic surplus - that thing that makes us want to trade/transact in the first place. Economic surplus is why you'd rather buy a Netflix package for $10 than rent a $3 video from the video store. You're massively better off with Netflix even though Netflix's profits and your wages haven't moved.\n" +
            "The problem is, we don't have a good way to measure this. Economists are aware of the problem, and it's something that makes comparison of GDP across decades difficult. There are many things that are better or flat-out new compared to what existed 50 years ago. How do you compare the experience of driving a modern, safe, smooth-driving car to an older one? Or the experience of talking cross-continent for practically nothing on Skype?\n" +
            "I agree that these technologies are going to reshape our world, I just don't think those gains are necessarily going to show up in GDP, at least not how we measure it today. And I also think this whole \"real wages have stagnated\" argument is a bit of a red herring. Maybe they have...so what. People are much, much better off today than they were even 20 years ago. We have more things, they're better in almost every way, less disease, the world is just 100% a better place, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to push some redistributionist political agenda. I'm not saying inequality isn't a problem, but it's borderline lying to suggest our lives haven't gotten any better over the last 30 years because \"real wages have stagnated\".","BitTorrent is not going away anytime soon. If anything, it's going to get stronger while every content creator and distributor has their own streaming service.\n" +
            "When streaming video started and became bigger, Netflix was seen as a single source for most content. Now, and in the future, this reality isn't going to hold good. It's already painful to figure out where one can watch a certain movie or show (apps like the TV app on Apple TV can help, but only if the streaming apps support it). Content keeps appearing and disappearing on different services and seems like a game of whack-a-mole!\n" +
            "BitTorrent's main draw is that it will always remain a single source (at least for relatively recent content) than any other streaming content provider can ever dream of! If at all torrent sites look like they're shutting down and don't have much activity, it's probably because all the activity with private trackers thriving is invisible. Yes, private trackers also get busted once in a while, but there are many that sprout up in the wake of one's demise. Whoever used the term \"hydra\" for this phenomenon was right.\n" +
            "Bottom line, as long as \"big content\" wants to haggle between themselves and focuses on making it inconvenient for customers to access content, BitTorrent will continue to thrive.","This view ignores revenue growth. If the company is growing like a weed it may choose to reinvest everything and keep profit near zero. If there's no dividend the profit would just go into a war chest and collect some minimal interest rate. If the company thinks it can get a better return on investment by spending all income on growing itself it has every reason to do so, and all it has to do is beat that minimal interest rate. The only reasons not to: you have no ideas where to spend your own money to result in growth, you expect that reportable earnings will look good to some investors, you want a war chest to make some giant acquisitions, or you're planning on starting to issue a dividend relatively soon.\n" +
            "Amazon has always had near zero earnings. Over the last 10 years its grown from ~$17 billion revenue to ~$140 billion in revenue. Yet they have almost no earnings! Barely profitable! It's wild and irresponsible! Yet Amazon is not on the brink of collapse. Despite near 10x growth their earnings have always been completely flat, near zero. Why is that? They're not booking earnings because they can't, they're not booking earnings because they're choosing not to, by spending it on growing themselves. It could be seen as a good thing: Amazon has lots of areas to invest in itself, if they didn't, maybe they're running out of ideas. Netflix has also grown by about the same multiple over the same time period as Amazon.\n" +
            "Now, on the other hand, Netflix's price to sales is about twice that of Amazon. Amazon's price to sales is about the same as Apple.","Like others say, buses are slow, but that misses the point of the article.\n" +
            "Seniors can't or won't walk very far. While buses are more flexible than rail in this regard, neither work for seniors in suburbia. Suburbia is incompatible with mass transit. Seniors want to be able to board and alight within 2 or 3 blocks of their terminus, maximum. Until we get automated cars, the only way to achieve that economically is with density.\n" +
            "I often tell people that San Francisco is the perfect place for seniors. Bus stops are usually a maximum of 3 blocks apart, sometimes only 2 or 1. And there are enough bus lines that there's at least one bus stop within a 2 block radius for the vast majority of residences, and often multiple stops for multiple lines within 2 blocks. In other words, you can pretty much get from any place to another other place without walking more than a few smallish blocks. Whenever MUNI tries to reduce the number of stops, irate and politically powerful senior citizens flood the hearings.\n" +
            "I used to live on a particularly maddening segment of the 3-Jackson line that literally had 4 regular stops on 2 blocks (5 stops in 3 blocks) coincidentally that stretch had two large housing projects--one exclusively for seniors and another predominantly for seniors--directly on the bus line, plus a population that skewed older more generally. The 3-Jackson line has at least 1 stop for most every block; the line averages about 1 stop per block! (I counted 29 stops in 31 blocks inbound.).","These have been around forever, I grew up in NJ and a friend's father was a cop so he had one. Definitely a corrupt thing that should be eliminated. A few dynamics I remember:\n" +
            "- many cops saw PBA cards as corrupt and insulting. So the rule of thumb was you never offered these, you just let the card be visible when reaching for your license. If the cop was in on it they'd then ask you about where you got the card. It was a huge no-no to offer it not just because some cops didn't take it but because even those who would could probably be offended by you not deferring to their authority to decide to ask about it (ie offer to give you a pass) or for being entitled. The net dynamic you wanted was the cop to of his own volition see the card and decide if he wanted to cut you a break since he knew you were connected to the police somehow. (Ie, total corrupt dynamic)\n" +
            "- a big variable was if they took the card or let you keep it. If you were a son or daughter of a cop you probably never got it taken. Otherwise you'd get it taken if you would have otherwise gotten a ticket. If you were just being pulled over for no good reason they'd probably not take the card from you so you could \"use\" it again.\n" +
            "- these were not gonna get you out of trouble if you did something more than speeding, talking on a cell, etc. If you ran a light or stop sign it was borderline. If you committed a felony or were drunk etc then flashing your PBA card probably would have made your life worse.","I do not understand your sense of ethics at all.\n" +
            "If the lawyer is in some way writing a will that benefits the friend more than the other wills the lawyer writes, or (worse) benefits the lawyer, that's unethical. If the lawyer is writing the will but just not charging, that doesn't seem ethically questionable.\n" +
            "If the doctor is stealing flu shots from the clinic that could have gone to people who couldn't pay for them except via insurance or another program, that is definitely unethical. If the doctor ... happens to have flu shots lying around? does this happen?? ... and has nothing else to do with them, healing people is part of the doctor's mission.\n" +
            "Letting people go after they have committed a misdemeanor is not part of a police officer's mission. It's rather the opposite of it. If a lawyer takes up a client's case, and argues weakly in court because the other side is a friend of the lawyer's, that is absolutely unethical. If a doctor prescribes a medication that the patient doesn't need because a family member works for the pharmaceutical company, that is absolutely unethical. And these things don't happen on a regular basis.\n" +
            "I'm sure that the doctor in your example would love to give flu shots to everyone, or the lawyer would love to make sure everyone has a will - they just don't have the time to write wills for everyone without pay. But the situation with the cop is the opposite: the cop spends less time not pulling someone over. The cop does not have a limited amount of tickets they can overlook; the cop actually has a limited amount of tickets they can write. If the cop wants to give everyone a pass on speeding tickets, that seems great. But they clearly don't - they are saying \"I have one set of standards for my friends, and another for everyone else,\" which is unethical. The doctor and lawyer aren't saying that.","Wrong. Police do their jobs out of a sense of duty. They don't do it because it's a popularity contest.\n" +
            "Respect is earned. For those officers that are genuine and honest, their community will see that.\n" +
            "The problem is that when you wear a uniform, you lose lots of your personal characteristics and people see you for the aggregation of everything that other officers do. When thousands of NYC police officers turn their back on the mayor+president during a speech for sticking up for civil rights of the entire country, police officers lose respect from me.\n" +
            "Police families are safer when they don't speed, or at least that's what our laws and our police tell us when we get pulled over. I'd prefer it if police families were kept in line just like those of us on the other side of the \"thin blue line\".\n" +
            "It's an abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\n" +
            "You may want to read up on ethics. \"Giving a free flu shot\" isn't an ethical dilemma. Giving your neighbor's kids an experimental vaccine without their parents knowledge or consent is.\n" +
            "I'm a tax-paying citizen. When small acts of police corruption are tolerated in my name, that's not insignificant. Small acts, unchecked, give police the feeling that they can get away with larger acts.\n" +
            "And this is coming from a guy with a cop in the family. His wife is already showing signs of questionable ethics. And she uses the same \"They have to know their families are safe\" argument.","For people without such radio equipment, it’s also possible to intercept Wi-Fi signals with a laptop or computer with a wireless card, says Simon Birnbach, a computer scientist at the University of Oxford not involved in the work.\n" +
            "In another test, a drone recorded someone wearing a strand of LED lights from about 20 meters’ distance. At five-second intervals, the person either flipped the LED lights on and off, or left them off. The drone camera’s data stream peaked whenever the LED lights flickered.\n" +
            "This strategy to discern a drone camera’s target is “a very cool idea,” says Thomas Ristenpart, a computer scientist at Cornell University not involved in the work. But the researchers need to test whether the method works in a wider range of settings and find ways to alter a drone’s view without cumbersome equipment, he says. “I don’t think anyone is going to want to wear a [light-up] shirt on the off chance a drone may fly by.”\n" +
            "Javaid agrees that this prototype system must be made more user-friendly to achieve widespread use. For home security, he imagines a small device stuck to a window that flashes a light and intercepts a drone’s Wi-Fi signals whenever it detects one nearby. The device could alert the homeowner if a drone is found scoping out the house.\n" +
            "Still, identifying a nosy drone may not always be enough to know who’s flying it. “It’s sort of the equivalent of knowing that an unmarked van pulled up and waited outside of your house,” says Drew Davidson, a computer scientist at Tala Security, Inc. in Dallas, who was not involved in the study. “Better to know than not, but not exactly enough for the police to find a suspect.”\n","Now there’s a way to tell if a drone is spying on someone.\n" +
            "Researchers have devised a method to tell what a drone is recording — without having to decrypt the video data that the device streams to the pilot’s smartphone. This technique, described January 9 at arXiv.org, could help military bases detect unwanted surveillance and civilians protect their privacy as more commercial drones take to the skies.\n" +
            "“People have already worked on detecting [the presence of] drones, but no one had solved the problem of, ‘Is the drone actually recording something in my direction?’” says Ahmad Javaid, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Toledo in Ohio, who was not involved in the work.  \n" +
            "Ben Nassi, a software engineer at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and colleagues realized that changing the appearance of objects in a drone’s field of view influences the stream of encrypted data the drone sends to its smartphone controller. That’s because the more pixels that change from one video frame to the next, the more data bits the drone sends per second. So rapidly switching the appearance of a person or house and seeing whether those alterations correspond to higher drone-to-phone Wi-Fi traffic can reveal whether a drone is snooping.  \n" +
            "Nassi’s team tested this idea by covering a house window with a smart film that could switch between transparent and nearly opaque, and aiming a drone with a video camera at the window from 40 meters away. Every two seconds, the researchers either flickered the smart film back and forth or left it transparent. They pointed a radio frequency scanner at the drone to intercept its outgoing Wi-Fi signals and found that its traffic spiked whenever the smart film flickered.\n","“A ‘hard’ surface like a table or water reflects almost 100 percent of sound,” says Wright. “We want to try to mitigate that by introducing an intermediary structure.”\n" +
            "Both water and air resist the flow of sound, a property known as acoustic impedance. Because of its density, water’s acoustic impedance is 3,600 times that of air. The greater the mismatch, the more sound is reflected at a boundary.\n" +
            "Adding a layer of material one-fourth the thickness of an incoming wave’s wavelength can reduce the amount of reflection. This is the principle at work behind anti-reflective coatings applied to lenses of cameras and glasses. While optical light has a wavelength in the hundreds of nanometers, necessitating a thin coating only a few atoms thick, audible sound waves can be meters long.\n" +
            "Even though it’s only one-hundredth the thickness of the sound’s wavelength, instead of the conventional one-fourth, the metamaterial still transmits sound.\n" +
            "“It’s a tour de force of experimental demonstration,” says Oleg Godin, a physicist at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who was not involved with the research. “But I’m less impressed by the suggestions and implications about its uses. It’s wishful thinking.”\n" +
            "One major problem that the researchers would have to overcome is the device’s inability to transmit sound that hits the surface an angle. In the lab, the device is tested in a tube — effectively a one-direction environment. But on the vast surface of a lake or ocean, the device would be limited to transmitting sounds from the small area directly below it. Additionally, the metamaterial is limited to transmitting a narrow band of frequencies. Noise outside that range reflects off the water’s surface as usual.\n" +
            "Still, the scientists are optimistic about the next steps, and even propose that a sheet of these devices could work in concert.\n","Something is giving small, pristine stars extra lithium. A dozen newly discovered stars contain more of the element than astronomers can explain.\n" +
            "Some of the newfound stars are earlier in their life cycles than stars previously found with too much lithium, researchers report in the Jan. 10 Astrophysical Journal Letters. Finding young lithium-rich stars could help explain where the extra material comes from without having to tinker with well-accepted stellar evolution rules.\n" +
            "The first stars in the Milky Way formed from the hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium that were produced in the Big Bang, so most of this ancient cohort have low lithium levels at the surface (SN: 11/14/15, p. 12). As the stars age, they usually lose even more.\n" +
            "Mysteriously, some aging stars have unusually high amounts of lithium. About a dozen red giant stars — the end-of-life stage for a sunlike star — have been spotted over the last few decades with extra lithium at their surfaces. It’s not enough lithium to explain a different cosmic conundrum, in which the universe overall seems to have a lot less lithium than it should (SN: 10/18/14, p. 15). But it’s enough to confuse astronomers. Red giants usually dredge up material that is light on lithium from their cores, making their surfaces look even more depleted in the element.\n" +
            "Finding lithium-enriched red giants “is not expected from standard models of low-mass star evolution, which is usually regarded as a relatively well-established field in astrophysics,” says astronomer Wako Aoki of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Tokyo. A red giant with lots of lithium must have had a huge amount of lithium in its former life, or imply a tweak is needed to some fundamental rule of stellar evolution.\n","Knocking out an animal 15 times your size — no problem. A newly identified toxin in the venom of a tropical centipede helps the arthropod to overpower giant prey in about 30 seconds.\n" +
            "Insight into how this venom overwhelms lab mice could lead to an antidote for people who suffer excruciatingly painful, reportedly even fatal, centipede bites, an international research team reports the week of January 22 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n" +
            "In Hawaii, centipede bites account for about 400 emergency room visits a year, according to data from 2004 to 2008. The main threat there is Scolopendra subspinipes, an agile species almost as long as a human hand.\n" +
            "The subspecies S. subspinipes mutilans starred in studies at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China and collaborating labs. Researchers there found a small peptide, now named “spooky toxin,” largely responsible for venom misery.\n" +
            "This toxin blocks a molecular channel that normally lets potassium flow through cell membranes. A huge amount of the biochemistry of staying alive involves potassium, so clogging some of what are called KCNQ channels caused mayhem in mice: slow and gasping breath, high blood pressure, frizzling nerve dysfunctions and so on. Administering the epilepsy drug retigabine opened the potassium channels and counteracted much of the toxin’s effects, raising hopes of a treatment for these bites.\n","The inclusion of internships for all the students, Fadel says, “is critical in providing practical training. It means they can demonstrate what they’re learning in their classes in the workplace right away.”\n" +
            "And that combination, he says, provides “value for the students, but also value for the companies. It’s a way of identifying and refining talent for them.” As for the students, “this will be a real resume booster.”\n" +
            "After this initial year, Fadel says, the hope is that the program will expand, in both the number of students accepted and the locations where it is offered. Already, he says, “we’ve gotten tremendous support from the MIT community.”\n" +
            "At the kickoff two-week session in Amman, students are working both individually and in teams, with activities including using a maker lab, working with coding architecture, and participating in design and innovation workshops, soft-skills seminars, and industry panels. They are also familiarizing themselves with the edX platform they will be using, and getting to know the instructors.\n" +
            "As the year goes on, many of the students will be able to stay in touch and share experiences through local centers where they can work and study together. Others who are not in close proximity will be able to connect through a dedicated Facebook page, Fadel says.\n" +
            "“What we’re really doing is offering the students an opportunity to sharpen their skills in computer and data science, but also in innovation and how to be entrepreneurial,” Fadel says.","Before coming to MIT, Jeff Orkin SM ’07, PhD ’13 spent a decade building advanced, critically acclaimed artificial intelligence (AI) for video games.\n" +
            "While working on F.E.A.R., a survival-horror first-person shooter game, he developed AI that gave computer-controlled characters an unprecedented range of actions. Today, more than 10 years later, many video game enthusiasts still consider the game’s AI unmatched, even by modern standards.\n" +
            "But for Orkin, the game’s development inspired a new line of interest. “A big focus of that game was getting squads of enemy characters to work together as a team and communicate constantly,” Orkin says. “That got me really into thinking about, ‘How do you get machines to converse like humans?’”\n" +
            "Following the game’s release in 2005, Orkin enrolled in the MIT Media Lab, where he spent the next eight years tackling that challenge. Now, through his startup Giant Otter Technologies, he’s using his well-honed AI skills to help chatbots expertly navigate tricky human conversations.\n" +
            "Giant Otter’s platform uses AI algorithms and crowdsourced annotators to build a natural-language database, compiled “bottom-up,” from archived sales and customer support transcripts. Chatbots draw on this robust database to better understand and respond, in real time, to fluctuating, nuanced, and sometimes vague language.\n" +
            "“[The platform] was inspired by the way episodic memory works in the human mind: We understand each other by drawing from past experiences in context,” says Orkin, now Giant Otter’s CEO. “The platform leverages archived data to understand everything said in real time and uses that to make suggestions about what a bot should say next.”\n","Finally, inexorably, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has clawed all the way up to Donald Trump himself.\n" +
            "Now a foreboding moment looms for his presidency and for the nation.\n" +
            "A stunning barrage of revelations on Tuesday suggested that at least one strand of Mueller's Russia probe is racing toward its end game, emphasizing the gravity of the situation facing the White House and the potential vulnerability of the President.\n" +
            "Mueller's request to question Trump, and news that his team has already interviewed fired FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, indicate that the special counsel has a clear picture of where he is headed in what could turn into an obstruction of justice case, legal experts said.\n" +
            "\"It's possible that Mueller is closing in on his determination about what obstruction looks like, whether it is a criminal offense in his mind, whether it is an impeachable offense, or whether it amounts to nothing,\" Michael Zeldin, a former senior aide to Mueller at the Justice Department, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin.\n" +
            "Tuesday's bombshells came amid new signs that Trump is still pushing up against constitutional norms in his conduct toward judicial authorities usually seen as independent of the President.\n" +
            "The current FBI Director Christopher Wray threatened to quit, a source familiar with the situation told CNN, after coming under pressure from Sessions, to clean out senior leadership figures dating from the Comey era who the President believes are biased against him. The development was first reported by Axios.\n","It's been over six years since the northeast coast of Japan's Honshu island was hit by a devastating earthquake, leading to a deadly tsunami and nuclear disaster.\n" +
            "The hardest hit of all the affected prefectures, Fukushima is still fighting to lure tourists back to its beautiful natural landscapes.\n" +
            "Among the locals helping revive the local travel industry is Jun Yamadera, founder of bike share company Fukushima Wheel, based in the prefecture's capital of the same name.\n" +
            "\"In the year of 2011, we have almost no people,\" says Yamadera. \"It really hurt my feelings. That's my main motivation to start this project.\"\n" +
            "Like other bike share systems, Fukushima Wheel encourages citizens and tourists to explore the city on a shared bicycle. But there's so much more to the project.\n" +
            "It also serves as a cost-effective way to collect big data from the city through citizen science. An environmental sensor has been mounted on each bike, measuring data such as radiation levels, temperature, air pollution and more.\n" +
            "The wheels are equipped with LED displays that can be customized to show advertisements.\n" +
            "The project also comes with a complementing smartphone app that doubles as a city guide, offering points-of-interest and discounts to the venues around you. It also measures how much you've exercised and carbon emissions.\n" +
            "Fukushima Wheel is still in development stage but it has already received enthusiastic praises from media and tech fairs around the world.\n" +
            "To find out more about the program, check out the above video or visit Fukushima Wheel's website.\n","Most neuromorphic chip designs attempt to emulate the synaptic connection between neurons using two conductive layers separated by a “switching medium,” or synapse-like space. When a voltage is applied, ions should move in the switching medium to create conductive filaments, similarly to how the “weight” of a synapse changes.\n" +
            "But it’s been difficult to control the flow of ions in existing designs. Kim says that’s because most switching mediums, made of amorphous materials, have unlimited possible paths through which ions can travel — a bit like Pachinko, a mechanical arcade game that funnels small steel balls down through a series of pins and levers, which act to either divert or direct the balls out of the machine.\n" +
            "Like Pachinko, existing switching mediums contain multiple paths that make it difficult to predict where ions will make it through. Kim says that can create unwanted nonuniformity in a synapse’s performance.\n" +
            "“Once you apply some voltage to represent some data with your artificial neuron, you have to erase and be able to write it again in the exact same way,” Kim says. “But in an amorphous solid, when you write again, the ions go in different directions because there are lots of defects. This stream is changing, and it’s hard to control. That’s the biggest problem — nonuniformity of the artificial synapse.”\n" +
            "Instead of using amorphous materials as an artificial synapse, Kim and his colleagues looked to single-crystalline silicon, a defect-free conducting material made from atoms arranged in a continuously ordered alignment. The team sought to create a precise, one-dimensional line defect, or dislocation, through the silicon, through which ions could predictably flow.\n" +
            "To do so, the researchers started with a wafer of silicon, resembling, at microscopic resolution, a chicken-wire pattern. They then grew a similar pattern of silicon germanium — a material also used commonly in transistors — on top of the silicon wafer. Silicon germanium’s lattice is slightly larger than that of silicon, and Kim found that together, the two perfectly mismatched materials can form a funnel-like dislocation, creating a single path through which ions can flow.\n","WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, which had sponsored a table at the dinner, said it was withdrawing its future support.\n" +
            "Boss Sir Martin Sorrell, who did not attend, told BBC Radio 4's Today his guests did not see such behaviour and said: \"We won't support the charity in future, which is regrettable because it is a charity that supports numerous children's charities and has done a lot of good work.\"\n" +
            "Real estate investment business Frogmore said the guests at its table were \"unaware of any of the described events but in no way condone this behaviour\" and it will now end its association with the event.\n" +
            "Part of the event included a charity auction, with one of the prizes being the chance to have tea with Bank of England governor Mark Carney.\n" +
            "However, a Bank of England spokesman said it was not aware of the dinner and \"did not approve any prize\".\n" +
            "He said it was understood a prize donated by the Bank to the Lord Mayor's Appeal charity auction had been re-gifted by the winner to the Presidents Club event.\n" +
            "\"The unauthorised re-auctioning of the prize at the Presidents Club dinner was clearly against the spirit of the original donation,\" he said.\n" +

The novel is told from the perspectives of twin sisters Olanna and Kainene, a 13-year-old houseboy and Richard, a British expatriate who is in love with Kainene. Olanna’s academic boyfriend, who favours secession, is also a key character as Adichie shows the repercussions of postcolonial power struggles on individual lives. “Adichie's novel is a tour de force, artistically and intellectually,” notes critic Walton Muyumba, author of The Shadow and the Act. “It is also a serious political novel about love in wartime.” Adichie’s 2013 novel Americanah also ranked high in the poll, but missed out on a spot in the top 12 by one vote.","McEwan’s haunting and beautifully crafted novel opens on a summer day in 1935, when 13-year-old Briony shows her mother a play she’s written to perform with her three young cousins the next evening. “Briony was hardly to know it then, but this was the project's highest point of fulfillment,” McEwan writes. “Nothing came near it for satisfaction, all else was dreams and frustration.” That evening, Briony witnesses her 15-year-old cousin Lola being assaulted in the darkened woods. Her testimony implicates Robbie, her sister Cecilia’s boyfriend from Cambridge and son of the family house maid, and he is jailed. In a second section, McEwan gives a panoramic account of the harrowing evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, with Robbie among those saved. Realising she has ruined Cecilia and Robbie’s lives, Briony works as a nurse during the Blitz in a third section. As McEwan follows these characters through six decades, Briony’s search for redemption evolves into a meditation on the power of art.","Franzen’s edgy multigenerational family saga, winner of a US National Book Award, was among the first novels to capture the zeitgeist of the century’s first decade. As Alfred and Enid Lambert and their three far-flung adult children gather at the end of the 20th Century for “one last Christmas”, the father’s Parkinson’s disease progresses, and the US is on the verge of economic meltdown. “The Correction, when it finally came, was not an overnight bursting of a bubble but a much more gentle let-down, a year-long leakage of value from key financial markets,” writes Franzen. This “astonishing third novel – a masterpiece of voice, character, and storytelling – is both epic and intimate,” New York Times columnist Carmela Ciararu notes. “Franzen secured his place as a major American writer.” Laurie Hertzel, senior books editor of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune adds, “This big, sprawling, fat novel touches on some of the most important themes of the early years of this millennium – economic uncertainty, the conflicts between parents and their drifting middle-aged children and the enormous issues of an aging society past its prime. He does it with great storytelling and a lot of humour.”","Unlike Germany, where saunas are mixed, the Finnish tradition is that — outside the family circle — men and women visit the sauna separately. Even so, for non-Finnish newcomers, the first session in the log cabin with colleagues might not be quite as relaxing as it’s meant to be. “It was a bit of a stepping stone to get over,” says Kristof Minnaert, a Belgian who moved to Helsinki in 2013 to join the staff of game developer Remedy Entertainment. The company’s studio and offices in Espoo have a rooftop sauna. “You have to be naked to get in there. It’s kind of frowned upon if you do wear a towel or swimming shorts,” adds Minnaert, 30, a senior character technical artist.\n" +
            "After three years, however, he’s grown at ease with the Friday evening ritual of a sauna with colleagues, where it's also common to sip a beer and then step outside onto the open-air terrace sans clothing. He and his team spend between one and three hours in the sauna each week and while they don't formally conduct meetings, they do talk about work and, sometimes, end up with good ideas to pursue back at their desks.\n","Quincy wrestles with his son, Kyrie, on the couch while his partner, Boosie, sits unimpressed by their roughhousing. (Ross cuts to an intertitle as soon as she walks away. “Carrying twins now, Boosie careth not about the film.”) Daniel, a student at Selma University, runs basketball drills, circling the paint and lining up his shots as Ross follows along, his camera locked to his athletic form as he carries out his practice with clockwork precision. We watch cotton fields passing by as Ross films Alabama from the window of a car, the sounds of a school basketball game playing in the background. There’s a timeless weight assigned to these images; the routines most of us would write off as trivialities are, through Ross’ eyes, made recognizable as individual pieces of a greater whole. “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” is humbly existential. Ross prefers to let his material speak for itself than pronounce the film’s greater meaning.\n" +
            "The closest he comes to hand-holding his audience occurs at the half hour mark, when he takes a trip to a disused plantation house and cuts from the drive to its doorstep to footage of Bert Williams, a vaudevillian blackface performer, sneaking peeks to camera, as if observing Ross’ arrival in a fit of suspicion. “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” is a Southern film through and through, but no scene in the film better illustrates the link between the past and present of America’s Black Belt; Ross remarks effortlessly on the still-standing reminders of the country’s past racism and the role they play in its current racism. It’s the longest he lingers on the subject of prejudice, with other signifiers, like a brief roadside encounter with the police, providing buttressing corroboration for Ross’ commentary.\n");
