You've done the same with 3 gatsu no lion regarding people having value. It come off as you being forced to talk about the video because other people are making videos about it. You even preference this point many times in this video, and it's a wonder how you don't think that isn't manipulation to a degree but recollecting emotions is. Is immediacy the only standard by which emotions can be conveyed more than what is said?","I want to thank you for helping lessen the disconnect between me and my emotions.  You seem to feel things in a similar way to me, and over time your videos have made me feel things more directly.  Even when you talk about issues that I don't have personally, such as gender identity, hearing the way you feel them helps me.  Recently I've actually been starting to feel things other than anger and frustration without having to look at them and decide that's what I'm feeling, and it's nice.  I'm sure I'll always be quite a dispassionate person, but it's a relief to not feel that my emotions are alien to me, or at least not as much.  There seem to be a fair number of people here complaining that you didn't talk enough about the film, but to me this was like the cherry on top.\n" +

            "favorite endings for any anime movie, why is this... throughout the entire movie Shoya never cried, not once, during all of the difficulties he had to face, he was always, disconnected. Then during the end when he finally opened himself up and started crying, spurred by all of the people close to him flashing through his mind, it was so emotionally satisfying for me because I felt like he finally and truly confronted himself, and how he was feeling and just let it all go, and during that whole scene, I had tears in my eyes as well. Its such a satisfying and uplifting ending that it completely grabbed me by the heart and took me for a roller coaster ride, and it will remain as one of my favorite endings of any anime film I've ever watched. This video was actually great and made me just wanna pour out what I feel through the comment section, I love your work.","This is the reason in real life some people are not directly opening up their heart. Because most of us are afraid how other individuals will respond, act, and react. Since it is quite obvious that bullying is still a problem in today’s world.\n" +

My mom just hired a painter to paint her new house. The painter didn't take an appreciably shorter time period than a couple pre-teens did. IIRC, it took us about a week for about 800 square feet worth, and it took the professional 3 weeks for 2400 square feet. And yeah, we did the whole masking-tape, dropcloth, and primer routine as well, and our corners were just as good.

I was greatly surprised when I heard that you are going to work overseas for such a long time. You have to know that I will miss you, but I’m glad that you would like to keep in touch with your relatives, especially your grandparents. It’s nice to hear that you ask my opinion about teaching them how to use the computer, so I tried to write down some important things, here it is. \n" +
            "As you know, electronic communication, such as e-mail or skype has advantages and disadvantages too. \n" +
            "About the advantages: if you want to tell something very important to somebody, you don’t need to go to the post office to send a letter and wait for days to get the answer, just access the Internet and that’s it. I know that there is an other option, which is a mobile phone, but what if the person switched it off? So, the Internet is fast, and you don’t have to pay so much money for it, e.g.: you can write an e-mail in an Internet caffe too. But on the other hand, it’s possible that the computer beaks down or catch a a virus, or there is no electricity in your town. \n" +
            "You can ask an important question: how these elderly people could learn the use of modern electronic devices? My answer is, that you should show them how to call people with a mobile phone (just press the green button) or write an e-mail with a computer. After it, it’s necessary to practise these two tasks before you have, to remember the method of calling a person or writing an e-mail. Of course you can write down the steps on a piece of paper, in this way they can make it without you. \n" +
            "In my opinion, teenagers use the computer usually, because with the help of the computer they can play computer games, listen to music, read an electronic book, chat with their friends and collect lots of imformation that is necessary because of a homework. I think that elderly people don’t use the computer usually, because they don’t care about it, they don’t have the skills in this modern world to use it, but there are some people of old age who want to learn how to use it. \n" +
            "Because of this, we have to teach them to use it. I think that a person can live without modern electronic devices, like our relatives in the past, but we live in a modern world and we have to keep steps with our technology, because if we not, we are going to be stupid people after a little time.\n" +

Success is a matter of having a product in the market and being able by means of the right capital outlay to minimise costs and maximise revenue.

We understand that Mr George Grant MP is particularly interested in this issue , and consequently , we would like to extend an invitation to him to join our meeting . \n" +
            "All our members feel that Mr Grant can make a valuable contribution to the meeting and as such we hope that he will be able to attend . We look forward to hearing back from you . \n" +
            "Yours sincerely \n" +

            "Understanding patterns in the magnetic fields of star-forming regions might help us predict how they will evolve in future. The strength of the magnetic fields in space could also influence how massive stars grow to be, and, potentially, whether planetary systems can form around them, Dr Santos added.\n" +

While flying at altitudes of about 12km (41,000ft), a large door in the aft fuselage is opened, allowing a 2.5m diameter telescope to observe the sky.\n" +
            "The aircraft can rise above most of the water vapour in the Earth's atmosphere - which can block some infrared wavelengths from reaching the ground.\n" +

Enforcement schemes such as setting strict speed limits on major roads and the use of congestion charges in city centres are two such examples as are vehicle exclusion zones or parking restrictions in busy pedestrian areas. However, it also makes sense to encourage motorists to become less reliant on their car. This can be achieved by making public transport more efficient and promoting the benefits of car-sharing with work colleagues, thus reducing weekly fuel bills. And the increasing number of cycle lanes on many roads is further evidence of how to win the hearts and minds of motorists in the fight against congestion.\n","The chart shows CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre for various methods of transport in the European Union while the pie chart shows European Union spending on transport . Flying by air produces by far the greatest CO2 emissions , approximately three times as much as passenger cars which are the next largest producers!\n" +
            "Very little is spent by the EU on air travel while roads make up more than half of the EU transport budget.\n" +
            "Trains produce about three times less CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre than passenger cars and eight times less than air travel . Nearly a third of EU transport funds are spent on railways .\n" +
            "Ships are a clean form of transport and produce about the same amount of CO2 per passenger kilometre as trains do . However , only 2 percent of EU funds are spent on ports . A further one percent is spent on inland waterways .\n" +
            "Coaches are the cleanest form of transport . Emissions of CO2 per passenger kilometre from coaches are half those of buses . Buses emit less than half as much CO2 per passenger kilometre as cars . The European union spends 10 percent of its transport budget on public transport , such as buses and coaches.","For the majority of the UK , the number of commuters decreases as commuting time increases . Almost half of the commuters take less than 15 minutes to get to their place of work , while only around 3 percent spend over an hour commuting . Indeed , three quarters of commuters outside London reach work within half an hour . In London , the trend is very different . The figures show that it takes much longer to get to work . Less than half of the commuters have reached work within half an hour , with the percentage reaching work in less than fifteen minutes significantly lower than the percentage reaching work in thirty minutes . Moreover , forty percent of people spend up to an hour commuting , with an equal proportion in the 30-45 minute bracket and the 45-60 minute bracket , and a further sixteen percent commute for over an hour – over five times the proportion outside London.\n" +
            "Regarding the mode of transport , the car is dominant both inside and outside London , significantly so outside London , where other modes of transport account for less than a quarter of journeys . Of the other modes of transport , walking and taking the bus are more common than cycling , taking the train and using the underground . Inside London , the car accounts for about one third of commuting journeys . However , public transport is used for about half of the journeys , the train and underground being more popular than the bus.","Should we always aim to do what society expects of us? No, what society needs is individuality. Worrying about what other people think inhibits enthusiasm and creativity. Nothing new is ever achieved by conforming to expected social norms. This is not only true for society’s innovators: everybody needs a strong sense of their own worth as an individual. This is essential for psychological well-being and the ability to function effectively in one’s personal and professional life. Paying too much attention to society’s conventions can be counter-productive in these and other ways.","This is a very good answer Anja. You've given a summary of the person's character and the impact on him of the decision to save JFK.\n" +
            "The review is written in an appropriate format and in an engaging style that would hold the reader's attention throughout.\n" +
            "It's clearly organised. Starting with an introduction to the book, two main body paragraphs and a well-crafted conclusion bringing the review to a close. Good use of cohesive devices to link your ideas and sentences together.\n" +
            "Finally, you have used language flexibly and shown your ability to describe simple and complex ideas clearly. I have made a couple of stylistic comments, which I think helps a couple of sentences flow a little better, but these are subjective rather than corrections.\n" +

            "A young girl who suffers from a fatal disease and has her life-time limited by it, falls in love and starts a touching love-story with a womaniser man who is twenty years older than her. He has never had a long and serious date with another woman, for fear of love. In contrast, she is a lovely and full of joy girl who despite her disease, strongly believes in life and goes for it open-hearted. She teaches him how to love and he gives her strenght to fight for her life.\n" +

            "Though it is quite a predictable story, the film was directed with such gentleness that it touched my heart. Having New York in the Fall as part of the scenery was very helpful to create the right atmosphere for this touching melodrama which, despite the lack of originality, leads us to think about what is the real value of life. You will have a nice time watching this film.","Dear Prof Collins,\n" +
            "I am writing to express my agreement with the criticisms that you spread in the news concerning our school system's hindrance.\n" +
            "As you suitably mentioned, in the new century, named for researchers as the information era, we'd better have our children well prepared to face the future job market, otherwise the globalized competitors will knock them down.\n" +
            "Nevertheless, I have already realized that, as it is an ordinary concern in the population's opinion, drawing the politics attention to solve this problem might be an excellent short cut to raise funds to acquire some schools primary necessities.\n" +
            "Regarding the reforms that you've suggested, I would say that not only the schools are poorly prepared but our teachers do not have the necessary tact to interact with the students. Maybe a recycling compulsory course should be a good way to take them out from their desktop. It should probably cost less than replacing the whole team and indemnify all of them.\n" +

            "Augusto Yassuo Teoi.","Nowadays, many facilities could use money from local authorities. There are people who claim that cultural institutions should receive more money than other facilities. But which ones should receive more investment is open to debate.\n" +
            "On the one hand, museums should be the institutions that need to receive a lot of money because people have lost the interest in visiting and promoting them. In a world where true values are not respected as they should be, it is important to remember what really matters. Moreover, the young men should be aware of the importance of knowing basic things in different domains. For example, science and history museums provide people very interesting informations. Therefore, in order to have well-informed teenagers, the local authorities should give money to museums. With that money, it can be organised events like the day of open museums.\n" +
            "On the other hand, green spaces should also receive money from local authorities. Mainly because in big cities, where the air is very polluted trees can absorb many of the gases produced leading to a much healthier environment. Furthermore, there can be built spaces for kids to play and also running tracks for people who cannot afford to go to gym. It is important for people to keep doing exercises in open air and in my opinion, parks are the best place.\n" +
            "All in all, as far as I am concerned the most important facility that should receive investment from local authority are the museums.","Having listened to today’s radio programme about facilities that need financial help, I realised that sports centers and public gardens have been neglected over the years by the local authorities.\n" +
            "There are few sports centers out there that meet the right characteristics that a good sports center must have. This is one of the many reasons that people avoid sport. We see lots of kids nowadays suffering from obesity and other health problems caused by the simple fact that they don’t do sport.\n" +
            "Another reason for this is that people have nowhere to go out for a walk or to run in a nice place. Public gardens, parks for example are also lacking in numbers. The ones that are already there are not very nice and they don’t look very good.\n" +
            "I think that by improving this two facilities the population can benefit from this. By creating more sports centers, there will be some more jobs offered, and some kids might even follow a sports career. By making more public gardens people can get out more often and spend some good quality time relaxing.\n" +
            "I think that local authorities should invest money in both facilities because, this is a good way to increase the populations health.","In regard of a recent discussion about the facilities, which are financially supported by local authorities, I would like to write a few of my personal thoughts. Whether we are talking about sports centres or public gardens, there is no doubt that they are both a good thing to have in the city and should both be supported somehow. The only question then is which one of these is more important, what are the pros and cons of each one?\n" +
            "Let me start with the sport centres as I think these are a bit more problematic. Obviously, in our times where lots of people spend days sitting in their office staring at a computer, some sort of physical training is very important. We have to balance that shift in our lifestyles. The problem I see with supporting the sports centres is the number of activities that you can do at these days. There is almost countless list of either individual or team sports that we can think of, and each centre is usually designed for a specific type or at least a group of sports similar in its nature. Therefore I think that it is too difficult to support them equally and we can’t say which activity is better than the others either. Another reason for not financing sports as much as green parks is their commercial use. What I mean by that is that we usually pay for everything the centre offers us to do and therefore they are more able to last from their own money than gardens.\n" +
            "Regarding of the green spaces, the situation is much clearer I think. Every city needs gardens where people can sit and relax, but nobody is going to pay a tax for just walking around.\n" +
            "These factors lead me to my conclusion, that the public gardens are definitely a facility which should be financed from public money, whereas in the case of sports centres, the situation is questionable.","Who doesn’t like to watch, even from time to time, an old movie starring an iconic actors and actresses known all over the world? Marylin Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn – we know them all. Although the last one might be known as well as for not only being an actress, but also a voulanteer helping to fight hunger in Africa. Her latest biography – ,,Audrey’s Hepburn life” tells us the story of a girl, who has made an amazing career, became beloved by millions, won several Oscar awards and was concidered to be a fashion icon. Nevertheless this is not everything that she achived. Audrey always wanted to help other people. This is why after ending her career she decided to help people, who needed this help more than anyone else. The book tells us the story of years of exhausting work in Somalia – for people who needed her help the most. Douzens of photograph present how much she cared about them. The most surprising for me, was the fact that she honestly did not do it to have better public opinion, she was never boasting abot it. But thanks to her fame, more and more people started to get interested in poor districts of Africa. The result was magnificent. Her whole life is an amazing example of how hard work pays off. Propably this is why the book turned out to be such a success. I recommend it to anyone interested in her career and life, I promise you won’t regret it!","Many people are complaining about the younger generation, because they don’t behave the right way. But nobody thinks about this topic, in the right way. How should the younger generation know what is right and what is wrong? How should they know how to behave the right way?\n" +
            "The answer is that they need some help. Without help they can not get it and nothing would change.\n" +
            "Through many satirical television programmes children and teenager get a wrong impression of what is right or wrong. Most of the television programmes are not helpful for the improvement of the behaveour of young people. But adults should check what their children are like. They should offer them some advice.\n" +
            "Most teacher are looking after their pupils, but there are always some who don’t. I think that teacher should be able to help their students and influence them.\n" +
            "Beneath teachers and parents there are also other parts of the family which should be there for the child. It is more important to a child, but even “older” people are doing it. You will always copy your parents, family and other important people in your life. So every person which is in your life, is an example for you whether it is a good example or not.\n" +
            "All in all I think that it is more effective and even more important to be a good example to follow.\n" +
            "If you offer some advise to somebody, they will be shy at first, afterwards they will be thankful for it. But they will always copy you, or behave like you in certain ways. It just happens and otherwise we wouldn’t learn.","Report on the three-week study and work programme\n" +
            "Introduction\n" +
            "The purpose of this report is to evaluate the effiency of the three week study and work programme. It is based on my personal experience, which I recieved while taking part in the aforementioned programme.\n" +
            "General Findings\n" +
            "The programme as a whole was very engaging and helpful. As it took place in the language environment, many aspects of the English-language, which will not be taught in the class room, could be learned through this programme.\n" +
            "Points worthy of praise\n" +
            "The programme has found many buisnesses, with which they cooperate, therefore I could choose between many companies in which to complete the work part of the programme. While working for a company I learned a substantial amount of phrases and other jargon specific to that field, which makes the programme very useful, should you manage to be employed by a company, which deals with a subject you are interested in.\n" +
            "Issues\n" +
            "No issues can be raised about the work part of the programme. However the English classes that take place in the morning offer no substantial benefit over classes taken in my home country, even if they are taught by a native speaker.\n" +
            "Suggestions\n" +
            "Firstly the organizer of the programme should increase the amount of time, that is spent working during the programme and reduce the amount of classes taken. Moreover the organizer should keep finding more companies with which to cooperate, to make the programme attractive to more people with different intrests.","Title II different from net neutrality. Title II is a highly bureaucratic strong-oversight-in-all-things tool aimed at a completely different problem space, namely providing a legislative solution to the case-law-derived 1980s consent decrees with AT&T & IBM. It covers things that have nothing to do with what ISPs want to deal with as part of their businesses, and places the expensive burden of proof and compliance on the ISP. So yes, it makes sense that small ISPs would not want to compete with the AT&Ts and Comcasts of the world with their armies of compliance officers. You'd never see another small ISP formed again.\n" +
            "Instead Congress needs to create a separate Section III (or whatever) to address net neutrality specifically, and empower the FCC to act within that purview. The FCC does not get to decide on its own that it wants more authority than was previously granted it by Congress.\n" +
            "Congress (and the various involved presidents) deserve to have all the cannons aimed at them. As it stands, people directing their ire at the FCC chairs (on either side) are letting Congress get away with being irresponsible.","Yes that was our most recent national claim to fame in politics. Gianforte is not a good representation of Montana politicians. He is a party boy and his campaign was nearly a replica of Trump's in a time of political uncertainty. He went up against a very weak Democratic candidate and a very week Libertarian candidate. That event also took place on the night before going to the polls after most Montanan's had sent in their ballots through the mail. When it boils down to being a red state, you'll see more party line voters. However if you were to sit down with these red staters you'd find they're mighty different.","This is incorrect. Corporations are not allowed to donate to political campaigns, and that's been illegal throughout the US for a very, very long time.\n" +
            "Individuals (like you and me) who are unaffiliated with political campaigns are allowed to make political statements. And we're allowed to spend money to make those statements, as long as we don't coordinate with campaigns at any point. Citizens United ruled that individuals retain this right when they band together in groups to make political statements (again, as long as that group of people remains unaffiliated with political campaigns and does not coordinate with them in any way).\n" +
            "Montana tried to argue that this law didn't apply to state and local elections, but they were struck down, because... well, it was a particularly weak argument for them to make in the first place, from a legal perspective.","My point isn't that it was a strong or weak argument and if it should have been able to stand against Citizens United. Rather, my point was that part of the social and political fabric of Montana for the past century has been one of curtailing excessive political power held by corporations.\n" +
            "The Corrupt Practices Act of 1912 was a demonstration of the shift from corporate control of the state house to one where corporations were viewed very warily. It was recognized that a corporation is more likely to act in its own interest than that of the state or its citizens.\n" +
            "In the decades since then, this has found its way into many pieces of law and the political consciousness of Montana appears to be one that still views corporations through a wary eye. It is recognized that it is the responsibility of the state is to protect its citizens from corporations. Going by this report of the 50 states, Montana has fairly strong consumer protection.\n" +
            "So, let me rephrase my original statement... Montana is a state that appears to value protecting its citizens more than corporations as demonstrated by its challenge (the only state that did so) to Citizens United. That Montana is attempting to implement net neutrality should come as no surprise when one looks at the history of the state and its relationship with corporations.","And those are definitely valid concerns. And if those 'bugs' aren't preventable or fixed, I guess the question then becomes: whose irrationality kills everyone first, human's or machine's? Perhaps the situation is inevitable, just part of the Great Filter that decides which intelligence-type survives the birthing process into post-evolution. If machines don't threaten our very survival, something (or someone) else will.\n" +
            "Perhaps prejudices may be unavoidable in any intelligence, since we build stereotypes as predictive models and ML makes similar abstractions and assumptions which influence perception and predictions. Tangentially related, when TBI patients whose emotional centers are impaired, so is their ability to make decisions. Building a decision-making network without an emotional center may be impossible, since the two seem to be naturally correlated. It's probable an AI won't ever truly be 'emotional,' at least not in the near term.\n" +
            "So, in the end, it's reasonable to assume that the AI of the future that can crunch these complex problems won't tell people the answers, they will merely provide possible solutions with varying likelihood of success depending on goals and constraints. In the end, we will have to decide our own fate, and my point is maybe we don't have control over deciding our fate either way--such is the nature of fate.","Just to add a bit of a positive spin on this: even type-1 diabetics could take measures to both improve their health and reduce the amount of insulin they require.\n" +
            "I consider myself moderately overweight at this point (maybe 10-15kg). If I lost weight, I could reduce the baseline amount of insulin I need every day, thus reducing the amount of insulin overall that I need to pay for.\n" +
            "I also fully acknowledge that, upon getting an insulin pump (16 years ago), I instantly became aware that I had much more freedom to eat what I want, when I wanted and thus, put little effort to cutting back on sugar outside of switching to diet drinks. If I were to switch to a low-carb diet, or no carb (which is admittedly very hard, I've tried), I could further reduce my insulin costs.\n" +
            "Personally (keep in mind these numbers depend highly on each individual), if I got my weight down 10kg, and ate < 100g of carbohydrates per day, I could theoretically only require ~35-40 units of insulin per day. At 40 units, I would only need ~1.35 vials of insulin per month. Ballparking, I'd say my current rate is likely around 2 vials per month.","I once did a quick \"anthropological\" study with In-N-Out employees (read: fancyspeak for sitting down and talking to them about their job), I was quite surprised.\n" +
            "Most of them were very happy with their jobs, not just happy with pay and benefits and so on, but happy to work there. They found it a very welcoming and friendly work environment, where people were rewarded for initiative and trying to improve things.\n" +
            "Most of them didn't see themselves leaving the company any time soon, unless it was for a different job type (such as moving to an office job after finishing school).\n" +
            "It was a very good lesson on how job satisfaction doesn't need fancy cafés, ball pits and slides.\n" +
            "PS: Those were just my impressions from talking to a limited number of employees. Endless numbers of caveats apply.","I wonder if franchising vs corporate ownership makes a difference.\n" +
            "In-n-Out does not do franchises, which allows some long-term focus. They can take more risk, they can cross-subsidize underperforming locations, they can take a long-term view of their employees and see them as value creators, not expense generators. Things like careers and promotions are possible, where successful In-n-Out managers are moved up the chain or trusted with new location launches.\n" +
            "A new McDonalds'/Burger King/Taco Bell/Carl's Jr would usually be owned by some local dentist or a retired couple that poured their life's savings into the franchise, and need immediate cashflow. Any increase in expenses forces them to readjust the business model and drives down the ROI. There's also zero potential for promotion - that same dentist or retired couple are unlikely to be in the business of owning 100 franchises of the same kind and have a long-term view for growing their expansive empire.","I had a slightly different experience. In high school my first job was corporate Mackers in a Walmart. At 15 I was somehow the second most responsible person working there.. After high school I did another stint at a franchise location. The owner had an ace manager in there to \"turn around\" the store. Everything was ship shape and above board; top rating on store review was the expectation.\n" +
            "As committed as everyone was the one thing I would have seriously cracked down on was... Wait for it... Pulling the fries out early. A couple of the managers didn't have the stomach for waiting the full time when cars were stacked up. They were mistakenly prioritizing the service time (which is usually sacred TBH!) over the quality of the french fries. This is a huge mistake and Mcdonalds has very tight lifetime limits on fries for a reason; aint nobody wants undercooked or stale fries.\n" +
            "I always dropped my own fries for my free meal, and would often invite people in to purchase fries while I was there so they could be done right. A 1/2, or ideally 1/4, basket cooks the best and most evenly at the McDonalds prescribed cooking times IMHO. Full baskets without a cooking time adjustment would result in fries that are not quite so cooked properly.","What I found interesting in Japan, was it seems like employees working in the larger fast food chains had a pretty much guaranteed track to the corporate office if they were willing to put in the time working at the store and had credentials to match. Usually the employees are part time with no desire to climb up, but I met few people who worked at McDs or KFC during college and had a job offer or atleast an interview waiting at the end of it in the corporate office.\n" +
            "One guy I talked to was told that he had to put in a full year to be considered for interviews in the next graduating class, so he worked at McDs after college so he could interview the next year.\n" +
            "Do the chains in the US offer similar tracks? Does experience at the chain translate well to getting hired in the corporate offices? Seems like an easy way incentivize college students and graduates to work at a chain and actually take it seriously. I worked at a McDs as my first job, years ago and I still see a lot of the same faces when I go back home. Even when I was there one of the managers was complaining that after 10 years she was told she couldn't get her normal yearly raise because she was \"making too much money already\" according to the owner. Corporate could and should pay for/partially pay for college for managers without an education as a perk for high performers.","To what degree does income inequality, consumer debt, and rapidly rising barriers of entry to high-income fields contribute slowing GDP growth? Is there research and evidence on the subject?\n" +
            "I'm just an engineer with basic financial survival skills... but blind intuition suggests fixing those problems is necessary for a sustainable growing economy.\n" +
            "\"Trickle-down\" theory and growing inequality drains economic activity since the \"1%\" invest their money instead of spending it. They profit when the public consumes, unless short-sighted over-exploitation by some industries strangle general consumer activity...\n" +
            "It sure looks like we're being strangled. Off the top of my head: urban rent, health care, high consumer debt and student debt reduce disposable income while automation, exporting jobs, poor retraining for adult laborers, and lower small-business access to capital due to banking mergers lower actual income. When businesses close, some of their ex-employees will switch to high-skill high-demand jobs... but most will increase the labor supply in less skilled industries because they urgently need money - putting downward pressure on wages and working conditions.\n" +
            "If I'm wrong, I'd love to learn why, and what other systemic conditions explain our economic stagnation.","Not trying to invalidate your larger argument, but it's worth noting that there is no such thing as \"trickle-down theory\" . Never was, never will be. It's a strawman through and through, originating in mockery, amounting to nothing more than \"screw the poor\" slogan that no self-interested economist could have endorsed. Its only purpose is to ridicule the perfectly valid – and hard – question of optimal tax policy that achieves long-term budget prificit without stifling development of businesses. Hilariously enough, some less than savvy people with conservative inclinations have defended and adopted this strawman as if it was a legitimate model, but this has more to do with meme dynamics than with economic policies.\n" +
            "As for your larger argument, well, this is a just-so model. There are many different ones, in favour of different policies, of course. But, realistically speaking, constant growth of a developed economy was never possible. However well you reduce inequality or deal with automation-related job loss, there are limits to attainable market expansion. Stagnation or, at best, negligible growth are something we need to learn to face.","I'm not saying you're wrong. I understand where you're coming from. You raise good points. I think we need to add to this list one simple idea: regulation.\n" +
            "Housing costs are terrible. They're getting bad even in small towns like mine. There is no way that my house is worth 172k. For many, especially in California and states that followed their lead, housing cost are largely, not solely, due to regulation on new house starts. Environmental impact and associated costs make a new housing community in California on average 1 million dollars more expensive. For many, they don't even put shovel to sod.\n" +
            "Health in the US has a lot of this too. Governmental regulations and the AMA drive up the cost of doctors. All of this is well documented. Interestingly, the free market is coming to a possible rescue on the price of generics.\n" +
            "A good chunk of student debt is due to the government printing money for loans that students can't escape. School saw this bottomless supply and acted accordingly.\n" +

            "I'm not saying that regulation is bad. I believe in free markets, not unfettered markets. However, a lot of the regulation is old, duplicative, and contradictory. It makes being a business far more complex than it should be. Regulation hampers innovation. We need to remove regulatory cruft at all levels. We need to adopt evidence based regulations.","That's where Peter Thiel screwed up in his pessimistic premise about flying cars vs tweets (used as an illustractive example of course).\n" +
            "At the same time Thiel was making that claim, CRISPR, AI, robotics, VR/AR, blockchain/crypto-currencies and a massive general leap in automation were working their way into the economy. We're also about to take a leap forward when it comes to space tech and transportation improvements (from electric vehicles, electric planes, to hyper-loop and subterranean tunnel transport, those are all likely only the beginning of a new generation of transport tech; the power of combining electric vehicles + radically better software + lower cost, will be vast and will remake every nation). To add to all of that, China throws a big X factor into the global economy, they'll add additional spark to invention/innovation, accelerating competition and improvement between the US-Europe-Asia (Thiel's observations apply primarily to a time range when China was dirt poor, as recently as 1994 they had a mere $500b in GDP).\n" +
            "What's more important, flying cars (which are wildly impractical even if you can do it well), or curing Hepatitis C? We did the latter at the same time Thiel was expressing his pessimism. At least 70 million people have Hepatitis C world-wide. Flying cars are a joke by comparison to the extraordinary scientific accomplishment of wiping out HepC over the next two decades. Thiel set up his bold premise at exactly the wrong time.","If I understand correctly, you are saying that market sentiment that the stock market has reached its peak will result is real estate prices increasing. That’s a very optimistic take. When market sentiment thinks the peak has been reached, people start selling and you get a crash. Everyone can’t sell at the top.\n" +
            "I don’t think most people buy homes based on a guess of the stock market cycle. I think a more realistic model is: people sell stock and buy a house when it makes sense for their life and they can qualify. They take money out of the stock market (often a 401k) for the down payment and use it to meet reserve requirements. If the market crashes, people won’t be able to afford as much house and prices will drop.\n" +
            "If the stock market keeps going up, that will continue to be one of the factors supporting home prices.","How many people do you think crime syndicates employ? Also, maybe coinbase has changed its policies but when I signed up I just needed a bank account #. Also, if you don't intend to transfer to/from fiat, Coinbase doesn't need any ID AFAICT. So you transfer your several thousand bitcoin from your private wallet into the coinbase accounts you control. You then use coinbase's free exchange to send those coins to your laundered wallet that is set up for a legitimate cut-out business with all the right paperwork & whatnot for converting it to USD.\n" +
            "You do this so that each individual account can make small purchases over a long time horizon so it looks valid. Looking at coinbase's site, you only need a bank account if you're using fiat currencies. You'd probably also want to make it harder to detect all your laundering accounts by having them make purchases to other \"legitimate\" accounts too (e.g overstock) Obviously I'm not a criminal mastermind so this plan could very well fail, but I find it hard to believe that a digital cash currency couldn't be used to effectively launder money considering laundering is most effective for all-cash businesses (combined with good accountants/bankers like illegal organization employ these days to avoid all these problems).","I’m 36, live in the suburbs, and in recent years have gone (legally) blind from Retinitis Pigmentosa.

            "Why do people push for rail? Self-driving cars obviously can enhance this (the bus idea), but I suspect they will create even more traffic if we insist on having 5 passenger cars be 75% empty. Buses are great because demand can be reallocated easily.\n" +

            "EDIT: Rail definitely has its place, but you almost never hear anyone starting a bus project. Just curious to why there's relatively little mention of buses in the public transportation (new project) realm.\n" +
            "I imagine perfected public transportation would involve linking between self driving cars on the square mile level, buses on the square deca mile (is that a thing?), rail for a hundred mile radius and obviously planes thereon.","Before I got married, I went out socially a lot more. I discovered that even though the train station is 20 km away, it was faster (and more predictable) for me to ride my bike there, take a bath at the nearby hot springs and then go to the city by train than it was to simply take the bus there directly. This is where I got my love of cycling (and hot springs!).\n" +
            "As I alluded to earlier, a lot of the reason that Japanese trains work is due to Japanese culture. For example, companies that get a monopoly will rip you off, but only by so much. They truly have a sense of social responsibility. The UK moved from a national rail system to something similar to what Japan has and from what I can tell, it completely broke their rail system (I'll probably get some argument about that). However, from my perspective, it's pretty clear that rail is simply easier to make work well than busses. It doesn't necessarily follow that any area building a rail system will make one that works well (I come from Canada and though I love trains I am never going to give any more money to Via. Ever.).","I have a grandmother in San Francisco. It only works OK for her because she has a daughter with a car. Taking public transportation isn't something she could seriously consider.\n" +

            "However, there are two reasons why this would not work:\n" +
            "Police officers can choose to forgive minor infractions, i think everything below a certain fine can be waved. An example would be if you drove a little to risky or something else and don't behave like an idiot to the officer.\n" +
            "As soon as you are above these thresholds, it gets very dangerous for cops to let you off the hook. There is a crime called \"Strafvereitelung im Amt\", basically meaning trying to hide a crime as an officer of the law. it carries a sentence of at least 6 months up to five years and even trying to hide something is punishable. This can also break the career of an officer. So if you, for example, drive drunk and your buddy let's you off the hook, he should damn well be sure that his partner does not talk about it.\n" +

No one will hear you because, normally, only about 0.1 percent of sound is transmitted from water to the air. But a new type of device might one day help.\n" +
            "Researchers have designed a new metamaterial — a type of material that behaves in ways conventional materials can’t — that increases sound transmission to 30 percent. The metamaterial could have applications for more than poolside play. A future version might be used to detect noisy marine life or listen in on sonar use, say applied physicist Oliver Wright of Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, and a team at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, who describe the metamaterial in a paper accepted to Physical Review Letters.\n" +

            "Smartphones make for such versatile pocket assistants because they’re equipped with a suite of sensors, including some we may never think — or even know — about, sensing, for example, light, humidity, pressure and temperature.\n" +
            "Because smartphones have become essential companions, those sensors probably stayed close by throughout your day: the car cup holder, your desk, the dinner table and nightstand. If you’re like the vast majority of American smartphone users, the phone’s screen may have been black, but the device was probably on the whole time.\n" +
            "“Sensors are finding their ways into every corner of our lives,” says Maryam Mehrnezhad, a computer scientist at Newcastle University in England. That’s a good thing when phones are using their observational dexterity to do our bidding. But the plethora of highly personal information that smartphones are privy to also makes them powerful potential spies.\n","Online app store Google Play has already discovered apps abusing sensor access. Google recently booted 20 apps from Android phones and its app store because the apps could — without the user’s knowledge — record with the microphone, monitor a phone’s location, take photos, and then extract the data. Stolen photos and sound bites pose obvious privacy invasions. But even seemingly innocuous sensor data can potentially broadcast sensitive information. A smartphone’s movement may reveal what users are typing or disclose their whereabouts. Even barometer readings that subtly shift with increased altitude could give away which floor of a building you’re standing on, suggests Ahmed Al-Haiqi, a security researcher at the National Energy University in Kajang, Malaysia.\n" +
            "These sneaky intrusions may not be happening in real life yet, but concerned researchers in academia and industry are working to head off eventual invasions. Some scientists have designed invasive apps and tested them on volunteers to shine a light on what smartphones can reveal about their owners. Other researchers are building new smartphone security systems to help protect users from myriad real and hypothetical privacy invasions, from stolen PIN codes to stalking.\n","Aoki and his colleagues used the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii to find the 12 new lithium-rich stars, all about 0.8 times the mass of the sun. Five of the stars seem to be relatively early in their life cycles — a little older than regular sunlike stars but a little younger than red giants.\n" +
            "That suggests lithium-rich stars somehow picked up the extra lithium early in their lives, though it’s not clear from where. The stars could have stolen material from companion stars, or eaten unfortunate planets (SN: 5/19/01, p. 310). But there are reasons to think they did neither — for one thing, they don’t have an excess of any other elements.\n" +
            "“This is a mystery,” Aoki says.\n" +
            "Further complicating the picture is the possibility that the five youngish stars could be red giants after all, thanks to uncertainties in the measurements of their sizes, says astronomer Evan Kirby of Caltech. Future surveys should check stars that are definitely in the same stage of life as the sun.\n" +
            "Still, the new results are “tantalizing,” Kirby says. “It’s a puzzle that’s been around for almost 40 years now, and so far there’s no explanation that has satisfying observational support.”\n","\n" +

She is also a supremely good storyteller.” Karen R Long, former books editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer who now manages the Anisfield-Wolf book awards, adds: “This spare, multi-generational story inculcates a desire for transcendence, and makes a case for spiritual life in the 21st Century – its own kind of miracle.

It also was named as the number-one book by the most critics. “It is a big deal for me to fall in love with a book when its DNA is science fiction, fantasy and testosterone,” says Elizabeth Taylor, The Chicago Tribune’s literary editor-at-large. “This was only the second book by a Latino author to receive the Pulitzer Prize in fiction,” notes critic and author Rigoberto Gonzalez. “Oscar Wao reaffirmed the strong connections Latinos maintain with their ancestral homeland’s culture, language and history. It also re-energised these questions: Who is American? What is the American experience?” Critic and playwright Gregg Barrios concurs, “Díaz’s deft mash-up of Dominican history, comics, sci-fi, magic realism and footnotes totally rocks. Nerdy Oscar and the book’s macho narrator Yunior resonate as authentically as Roth’s Portnoy, Updike’s Rabbit, Bellow’s Augie or Toole’s Ignatius.”","It’s hard not to think of the irreplaceable Patti Smith when reading this profound and impressionistic novel, in which a rock star’s comeback tour becomes a meditation on performance, ambition, loves lost and found, the passage of time and the sparks that create art. As indie rocker Anna Brundage hits the road again in the Christiania district of Copenhagen, she is haunted by memories of past triumphs: “Music is quicksilver, gossamer; careers are measured in butterfly lifetimes.” She’s back in wonderland again, balanced precariously, aware of her power onstage, afraid she won’t be able to catch up. “Once you step away, you’ll always be at least a breath away,” D’Erasmo writes.

Lila completes the family circle by describing the life of the boy’s mother, Ames’ much younger second wife. Lila was orphaned and raised by Doll, a migrant worker during the desperate times of the Great Depression. Lila comes to the town of Gilead after Doll dies violently and ducks into Ames’ church during a rainstorm. “I just been wondering why things happen the way they do,” she tells him. “I’ve been wondering about that more or less my whole life,” he responds.

It’s set at an important point in their work, in the 1930s, when the three are all doing research along the Sepik River in New Guinea. King captures the exhilaration of field work, beginning with initial contact, when everything is new, including the language, and building toward the moment when, as Nell writes in her journal, “you’ve got a handle on the place… It’s the briefest, purest euphoria.” King alternates between Bankson’s narrative and Nell’s daily journals, offering varied perspective on her tale and building suspense as she explores the powerful forces that draw these three into deadly competition.","Like the bleakest-ever episode of Arrested Development, Michael Haneke’s Happy End is an abyss-black comedy about three generations of a business dynasty, each one psychotic in its own particular ways. Isabelle Huppert, Matthieu Kassovitz and Jean-Louis Trintignant play the Calais grandees who embody first-world callousness both at home and in the workplace, but who are chillingly sure that they’re in the right. They’re a loathsome bunch, but if the film’s grim view of humanity is upsetting, its ingenious structural trickery should raise a smile. Happy End is a series of murder mysteries. Haneke gives us tantalising glimpses of various crimes and misdemeanours, but we have to wait, each time, to discover what happened and who was to blame.","Under the cover of darkness rarely seen creatures migrate to the ocean’s surface to feed.\n" +

            "In turn, lantern fish follow vertically migrating zooplankton.\n" +

If you need convincing, try reading festival programming notes or, better still, put your eye holes on festival reviews as journalists feverishly crank out piece after piece, screening after screening; the scramble to beat everyone else to the punch and find the Next Big Thing™ before the rest of the pack is real and often inimical to the movies they champion. Hype, to an extent, is an understandable and even natural component of the festival dynamic, but if the verbiage sounds far-fetched, it probably is. Approach with caution.\n" +
            "But make an exception for “Hale County This Morning, This Evening,” the rare gem to live up to self-imposed promises made by programmers, critics, and publicists lured by festival temptations of magnified response. The “why” is simple: You haven’t seen “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” before. You’ve probably seen movies that echo in “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” — the freeform tone poems of Terrence Malick, the human clipshow of Kirsten Johnson’s “Cameraperson,” the rhythmic, unfussy films of Frederick Wiseman. But RaMell Ross has an element on his side that these artists lack — a level of honesty attained only through intimacy. Ross knows his subjects as more than subjects. He knows them as you know your friends, your family, your neighbors.\n","Something nearly coheres in the identification between Reed and the kooky and occasionally impotent killers of giallo films, but “Piercing” never quite gets there. Revelations about his past seem meant as jolts, but why he wants to kill is less interesting than what might happen when he gets in the same room with someone as extreme as Jackie. (And with all the giallo influence, the fact that Wasikowska enters the film wearing black leather gloves tips off some aspects of her personality.)\n" +
            "Given that this is a film in which people endure some seriously intense, even shocking stuff, Pesce deserves plaudits for crafting scenes that leverage a balance between comedy and horror to keep audiences from turning away. The paper cutout characters, however, can’t even stand up to the test of the film’s 81 minutes.\n","Darkly comic at times, this is a distinctive and disconcerting first feature which leaves itself open to several alternative readings. It screens at IFFR following its premier in the Discovery strand of TIFF 2017. Further festival berths seem likely; this is a film which is tailor made for strands highlighting unconventional new voices in cinema. It will, however, likely prove to be too challenging an undertaking for all but the most adventurous distributors.\n" +
            "Lagarde, who served as the cinematographer on Sabali (2015) and Vic + Flo Saw A Bear (2013), shot the film in Cuba, although the location of the story itself is unspecified. The Spanish-speaking hotel staff rehearse their French greetings and their welcoming smiles, in advance of the arrival of the latest bus load of tourists. Granite-faced Mike is the last to disembark and be greeted by mustachioed manager Valentino (Sylvio Arriola). From the beginning, the immense man in his duvet-sized holiday shirt exerts an uneasy fascination over the hotel staff and some of the guests.\n" +
            "Unnerving sound design disengages us from the prosaic daily routine of Mike’s vacation – whispered voices and mirthless laughs which seem to last just a little too long heighten the sense of weirdness. But the picture takes a turn into more bizarre territory when, having missed the airport shuttle, Mike decides to stay on at the hotel. Shortly afterwards, he rescues a beached octopus which thanks him, in Spanish, and confers upon him a gaze that will captivate and a mind which will discover purpose.\n","Two men sit in the middle of nowhere, stagecoach tracks leading off towards the horizon both east and west. Two men sit on a ramshackle bench awaiting their transportation. On the left is a older man dressed as a preacher (Robert Forster) who is both perturbed and spent, heading back East after failing to promote his religion to what he calls “the savages”. On his right is a younger man (David Zellner) looking to reinvent himself, heading West to an unknown future that surely will be better than his present. In a bout of existential determination, the preacher strips, gives up his clothing to the stranger beside him, and perpendicular to the path walks off alone, dressed in nothing other than boots and red underwear off to meet his maker in the wilds.\n" +

            "the most eye-catching investors in his real estate empire since he won the Republican nomination hail " +
            "from countries where there is a faint line between business and politics. And some of Trump’s biggest ideological backers have an almost apocalyptic sense that America needs to be purged in order to be saved. Hanging over everything is the figure of Vladimir Putin, a man who has devoted his career to accumulating information on weaknesses, both personal and political, and turning that information into power. Rather than Russia turning into America, as America’s policymakers argued in that great age of illusion, the 1990s, America seems to be turning into Russia.","The immediate task facing the American republic is to limit the damage that Trump can cause: Here the checks and balances are already playing the role that the founders intended. But the bigger task is to eliminate the weaknesses that have produced Trumpism. Frum rightly points out that these are broad as well as deep. The travails of the white working class are symptoms of a bigger problem: the concentration of wealth in a narrow range of industries and companies. Likewise, the corruption embodied in Trump Inc. is the product of a broader corruption of America’s governing class, which has allowed Bill and Hillary Clinton to transform themselves into public-service millionaires and Barack and Michelle Obama to negotiate a reported $65 million book deal for their autobiographies. Getting tough on Trump is going to be a picnic compared with getting tough on the causes of Trumpism.","Margareta Magnusson is writing for people with families like mine — and maybe yours. Americans are just too much, she gently suggests. Swedes embrace consideration and minimalism, and the practice of “death cleaning” (which can start in your 30s — why wait?) embodies those values. “Let me help make your loved ones’ memories of you nice — instead of awful,” she says, and proceeds to do just that in this short, practical guide to getting rid of stuff. You categorize, normally going from large objects to small; you give things away or sell them, particularly if you have a family you know is going to bicker. And you never, ever start with photos or other items of great sentiment because you’re likely to get stuck. And oh, how right Magnusson is. After my parents passed away, my own death cleaning consisted of looking at old photos, then immediately giving up — taking everything they owned and putting it into a massive storage unit that has sucked up money for seven years. I may have to reread her book.","The friendship/hateship between Susan and Ro, the ways in which each experiences the mere existence of the other as both a reproach and a criticism, is one of the great delights of this lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women’s lives. Ro cannot stop thinking of Susan’s offhand remark that “you don’t truly become an adult until you have kids.” Susan is preoccupied with the thought of Ro’s questioning her reasons for changing her surname: “How come nobody’s allowed to criticize a woman’s decision to give up her name for a man’s name? Just because it’s her choice? I can think of some other bad choices that—.” Both women keep lists: Ro’s is a self-flagellating inventory of reasons it’s a bad idea for an unwed 42-year-old to raise a child; Susan’s is a lengthy accounting of the unrelenting and grindingly dull routine of raising children: “Herd crumbs into palm. Spray table. Wipe down table. Rinse cups and bowls,” and on and on. Susan’s resentment of Ro’s rich intellectual life means the exhausted mother can’t empathize with the single teacher’s loneliness. But Ro’s corresponding resentment of Susan’s full family life means she can’t empathize, either, with her friend’s boredom and despair. These carefully chosen details feel urgent in our present moment, when women are constantly encouraged to compete with one another to attain an unattainable ideal of our gender.","Maybe, though, it is almost impossible to write the truth about these things without seeming — how like a woman! — hysterical. As with the return of fascism and the measles outbreak, it’s difficult to believe that mere foolishness and complacency could return us to the bad old days until we actually see it happen. And the novel gives the reader much to enjoy in the meantime. Zumas is a skillful writer, expertly keeping each of her characters in balanced motion, never allowing one to dominate the rest. Her cunning device of not revealing the name of each character in the sections she narrates grants us a multidimensional perspective on all four women, highlighting their roles in one another’s stories. It’s a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women’s lives — for the way that, as Paley would remind us, the laws that imprison or criminalize one of us narrow the options for all of us.","This is all so negative.
