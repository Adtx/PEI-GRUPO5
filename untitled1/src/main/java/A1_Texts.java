Saw tem and I HAD to watch!","So what causes the wite outlines (esp. on black) around the dried up sweat? I guess it's protins found in sweat that also make it salt, but it would be intersting to know more.","Yes I remember \"The Artist\". Grated it was't the best film of tat yer since Hugo and Drive for me were better but I relly like it. Agreed on the wole argment of multiple nominations.","I swear to god if Wonder Woman gets nominated to something, but LOGAN, Get out and Baby drive DONT, I'll......have to take all of my rage and keep to myself and unleashe on someone who doesnt deserve it.","How did sir Patrick Stewart not get nominated for that magnum opius that is the emoji movie! He was the best thing in that masterpiece?!","Anime movies get nominated by the year they come out in America.

I thought it was a pretntious, Oscar-bait film with flawed stortelling and caracter flow.","Shut up Peter! If you were put bak in charge of Fable 4 none of those idas/features would apear in the gme. And if they did they would be half assed.\n","Holy hell, stop acting like wonder woman was a good movie, it was borderline terrible and not nearly as original and groundbreaking as everyone makes it out to be. And yes I did enjoy suicide squad more (not by a lot tho).","Of course EA wasn’t hurt that much by the Battlefront 2 controversy. Now, if this same controversy had hit FIFA or Madden, then maybe that would have more of an effect.","Battlefront 2 did hurt EA, their public imge is completely damaged. \n" +
