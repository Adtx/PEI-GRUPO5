Good job.","I once sat in the board of a student organisation management a $3mil investment fund. Which was rapidly declining as funds where being withdrawn to cover budget deficits. At the same meeting where no-one could explain, and no-one seemed to care about a 100,000$ transaction listed as “assorted expenses”, people spend 1,5 hours debating whether the coffee-shop should keep buying newspapers for 200$ a year...","I'm a die-hard DIYer. I hire out drywall and blueboard/skimcoat work. Two guys who do that work everyday can do in a 6-hour day and ~$800 what it would take me two weeks and $300 in materials and their job looks 4x better than mine.","My argument is that painting is a much smaller skill difference between a hobbyist and a mediocre professional.\n" +

I have a friend who used to drag us to play Camelot in some strange bar. Fast forward 10 years, he translated or edited most of titles I play these days. As in, his name in credits of every other box.","Yesterday Tom had his breakfast. He then went for a walk with his dog and some friends. After the walk they had a picnic. Everybody had a good day. In the evening Tom was tired and went to bed.\n","If my chef sees me trying to separate the yolks from the whites like this guy he'll probably shit his pants. These ain't hacks what this guy is doing is making it more harder as it is.","I live here and have some familiarity with the ISP landscape. I'm going to bet that all* ISPs operating in the state are going to have contracts with the state.","Yeah, I'm pretty sure my ISP is the only one in the county, so there is a good chance the serve the schools and government buildings.","i remember when adam got that D.Va art on an episode of dudesoup, is he keeping it in the plastic for good condition or did he just never bother taking it out.","Remember when they complain to viewers back in IG Q&A about low hanging fruit questions like \"what would you be/pick and why\" and that's all the type of questions there are in this show.","People are fed up with arging about the imperial and metric meauring systems. Funhaus is tasked with invnting a new uniersal measuring system what is it? Give me A1.","The human eye can't see past 1 fps. Anything labeled as above is a government conspiracy. 60fps is a level 60 conspiracy that dives into top level government secrets. 100+ is alien territory.","Tenkaichi is the best pure dragon Ball game made for the fans fighterz is the best fighting dragon Ball game made primarily for the fgc.","budokai 2 was king - if this is better somehow then i'll eat my hat. DBFZ is gorgeous tho, you gotta give it that - best looking cell-shader i've ever seen!","I'd be getting it if Monster Hunter World wasn't coming, I usually don't like fighting games but had a lot of fun in the beta.","Yeah, the game is really fun, not every fighting game need to be at evo and targeting only the hardcore fanbase of gamers. Thats why SFV failed so miserably to move units.","Funny that The Know or Rooster Teeth didn't talk at all about BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle and how Arc System Works, the same company that developped DBFZ, has locked half of its roster behind DLC, and that included both Blake and Yang, from their own show RWBY.","I love DBZ and fighting games even tho I suck at them. But I will wait for a complete edition with all the characters and all the re-released revisions(aka paid patches).","Umm...no one mentioned the season pass for extra fighters that was announced before launch. This is the sole reason that I will not buy this awesome game...","I don’t like how it’s 3v3 only. And it doesn’t have a character select screen before match, you must make a team beforehand in the open world lobby thing. Button mashing is so trash in this aswell. Honestly it had good potential but I doubt the fighting game community is gonna play this game for long. Also The VERY recent beta had garbage servers so that doesn’t bode well for the game’s launch.","The shutdown of Congress is akin to two children fighting over a toy at a daycare, and the nursery lady responding by putting everyone in the time-out corner until they behave themselves.","Trump has said in past interviews and on twitter that the president is responsible if a shutdown occurs. Now that a shutdown has occurred under his watch he's a hypocrite for refusing to take responsibility.","Back in 2013, Trump blamed Obama for the government shutdown because he said Obama was the president so he should take full responsibility, now he is blaming it all on the democrats, the guy's hypocrisy has no end.","This is why a Democratic Republic doesn't work. Two party system is destroying this country. We're suppose to have a balanced government. What is so balanced about one party controlling all three branches?","I've never seen a desk so clean of any documents or even knick-knacks. The Douchebag truly does nothing all day except tweet, watch TV (Fox and Friends) and fondle his cheeseburger in bed.","Kubo was told by Shuisha to jump into the Soul Society but he wantd too continue the stories with hollows. It's prboably the reason the transition feels weird.","When Feb rolls around & nothing has changed....you dems better hold out this time. If you want We The People to vote you in, you have to earn it.","If only there were some grown up person who would stop this blame game. [cough cough] a stable genius perhaps, with some leadership and deal making skills. Unfortunately, there is no such person.","the last time, the isue was the \"always on\" aproach. It was that ANY game you play had to have an active internet connection. Crappy internet would essentially make 400$ bricks.","xbox is not trying to compete, they are trying to kll the consoles and physical copy games. they are still pusuing the plan they announce on the release of the xbox one.","Fail.\n" +
                    "Shovelware o plenty is coming. If subscriptions go up so will the price . Then they will start tiering the service for the bigger games at different prices.","I live in South America and I have uncapped high speed internet. (300 Mbps with Cable, and is the cheapest available) So, here is a very large market for subscription based gaming.\n","It’s amazing to think of Devilmans influence almost every  anime protagonist has or ends up gaining the same power as the villains to fight them with\uFEFF.","Ironic how you guys were making the netflix kakegurui jokes and now its announced for Feb 1st.\n" +
                    "Also RIP Violet Evergarden not simulcasting in the US\uFEFF.","Ok guess this is wrong title which im glad cause that would be a really quick turn around to get impressions so early in the season lol love its gonna be all devil man crybaby talk!!!\uFEFF","God, why would you ever watch the Violence Jack OVAs? I hope whatever success Devilman gave might encourage a decent adaptation of it to be made.\uFEFF","Just a slight critique, I think you guys could have tied the topic a bit more into your idea/project of keeping old anime alive in the seasonal anime mindset. But otherwise, great podcast.\uFEFF","Boy I am late af. Glad to see anoter amazing Weebcast of yours, MB along with the lovely Gigguk and Anime Man! Saw tem and I HAD to watch!\uFEFF","So what causes the wite outlines (esp. on black) around the dried up sweat? I guess it's protins found in sweat that also make it salt, but it would be intersting to know more.\uFEFF","Yes I remember \"The Artist\". Grated it was't the best film of tat yer since Hugo and Drive for me were better but I relly like it. Agreed on the wole argment of multiple nominations\uFEFF.","I swear to god if Wonder Woman gets nominated to something, but LOGAN, Get out and Baby drive DONT, I'll......have to take all of my rage and keep to myself and unleashe on someone who doesnt deserve it\uFEFF.","How did sir Patrick Stewart not get nominated for that magnum opius that is the emoji movie! He was the best thing in that masterpiece?!","Anime movies get nominated by the year they come out in America. Spirited Away came out in Japan in 2001 but it came out in America in 2002 and it won for 2002.\uFEFF","Couldn’t disgree more with you on Moonlight. I felt little to no emtion or impact. I thought it was a pretntious, Oscar-bait film with flawed stortelling and caracter flow.\uFEFF","Shut up Peter! If you were put bak in charge of Fable 4 none of those idas/features would apear in the gme. And if they did they would be half assed.\uFEFF\n","Holy hell, stop acting like wonder woman was a good movie, it was borderline terrible and not nearly as original and groundbreaking as everyone makes it out to be. And yes I did enjoy suicide squad more (not by a lot tho)\uFEFF.");
